13xcy1j	i use chatgpt to learn python	Clinnkk_	2023-06-01 09:28:57	i had the idea to ask chatgpt to set up a study plan for me to learn python, within 6 months. It set up a daily learning plan, asks me questions, tells me whats wrong with my code, gives me resources to learn and also clarifies any doubts i have, its like the best personal tuitor u could ask for. You can ask it to design a study plan according to ur uni classes and syllabus and it will do so. Its basically everything i can ask for.	https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xcy1j/i_use_chatgpt_to_learn_python/	ChatGPT	7037	7037	641	Educational Purpose Only 	reddit

Also along this should I use ""freecodecamp"" or ""codecademy"" or do you have some other recommendation?"	AlternativeThink98	2022-02-26 17:50:45	"Hi, I am new to programming. I want to learn programming for the career opportunities and because I started to get interested in it. I have a lot of free time and I can dedicate like 6 hours a day to learn. I read the ""New? READ ME FIRST"" and I see that many recommend the ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"". I also see that someone recommends to start with Python's official tutorial on their website but I hear that the tutorial there is for someone who already knows some programming. What do you recommend between the two?

Also along side that should I use ""freecodecamp""? I heard that some learned to code only using that and also they give certification and have a curriculum to follow so it would be easier. Do you recommend this or do you have other preferences like ""codecademy""?

Any additional advice or recommendation would be welcome. Thanks!"	https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/t22sil/i_want_to_start_to_learn_python_i_am_completely/	learnprogramming	87	87	53	Resource	reddit
10w01cs	Practical uses for Python for an average user ?	NomadJago	2023-02-07 11:56:41	I am struggling to find a reason to continue learning Python, as I am not looking to code for a career. Are there any practical uses for learning Python for everyday use? Yes I know about the book/website for 'Automate the Boring Stuff', but even that is not all that practical for me. One project I did find very practical was using Python to code a command line terminal based interface to chatGPT to avoid their web-based site (this came in handy yesterday when their website was overloaded, too busy, and I could not do a chatGPT session--- but I ran my console version using Python and was able to connect and do a session with chatGPT (that did not use the overloaded web port). So I am wondering about practical uses like that.	https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/10w01cs/practical_uses_for_python_for_an_average_user/	learnpython	166	166	134		reddit

I‚Äôm wondering what would folks not use Python for?  I‚Äôm considering to begin learning JavaScript because it seems so different from what I know. But I don‚Äôt want to get sidetracked from bigger goals unnecessarily.

My projects right now are MIDI focused w Arduino hardware using circuit Python and sometimes Regular Arduino IDE. Arduino‚Äôs C++ code now all makes pretty good sense to me and I can even write code that does what I want first or second try (all pretty simple stuff honestly).  Thanks Al!

In the future, the dream project is to make a smartphone game app comprising of different simple mini games using open CV.

zg2i87	Learn Python with the NBA Giveaway!	NukishPhilosophy	2022-12-08 15:42:36	"Hi everyone,

I recently came out with a course on learning Python with NBA data for complete beginners. (some of you may know me from /r/fantasyfootball)

[Link to the course here](https://www.fantasydatapros.com/basketball)

This is a giveaway I'm doing for lifetime access. **Just upvote and comment anything below to enter**. 

For those who don't know, Python is a beginner friendly programming language that's very popular for data analysis. As a first programming language, it's a perfect fit for a beginner who wants to learn a programming language and is obsessed with basketball.

The overall goal of the course is to introduce coding to you through a fun and engaging subject matter you probably enjoy if you're on this sub - basketball. A lot of people have reported back to me that my courses are the thing that finally got programming to ""click"" for them after countless udemy courses and e-books. I dont think thats because I'm the best coding educator out there. There's some great out ones there, prob better than me, who I've learned a ton from and owe a lot to like Brad Traversy, Corey Schafer, and Sentdex. I actually think the reason is because the best and most engaging way to learn to code is through subject matters that interest you. For example, a lot of beginner data science courses start you out by predicting housing prices.  That's fine, but wouldn't it be more interesting and engaging to introduce you to predictive analysis by teaching you to make a model to predict the NBA MVP this season? 

With this in mind, each section of the course has some sort of basketball/NBA focus, all along the way introducing you to more and more complex programming/data science topics. The course walks you through the set up of Python, all the way to writing machine learning models to predict points scored for the season for certain players, predict who will be MVP, and rank players into tiers for fantasy basketball. It comes with 10 sections of material, 8 hours of video, and access to a Slack channel where you can personally ask me questions when you get stuck (I'm on Slack all day so I usually respond pretty quickly).

Anyway, the mods ok'd it, so I figured id do a giveaway - **just upvote and comment anything below, and I'll randomly select (with a python script, of course) 10 people to get free lifetime access to the course after the Nuggets game tonight.** (Will select more if a lot of people enter)

Thanks for reading. You guys are awesome

And good luck!

edit:

Some ppl asked about cost. It‚Äôs $55, but you can use the code `NBA` for $15 off

**Winners posted below. Congrats and thank you to everyone!! If you won will be reaching out tmrw.**

kn41qn	Learn Python with Fantasy Football Giveaway!	NukishPhilosophy	2020-12-30 15:18:50	"Hi all,

[I recently created a course on learning Python with Fantasy Football for complete beginners.](https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com)

For those that don't know, Python is a beginner-friendly programming language that's really popular for data analysis. As a first programming language, it's a perfect fit for a beginner who wants to learn a programming language and is obsessed with fantasy football. 

The overall goal of my course is to introduce coding to you through a fun and engaging topic you all enjoy, fantasy football. A lot of people have reported back to me that this course was the thing that finally got programming to ""click"" for them after going through countless udemy courses and e-books. I don't think that's because I'm the best coding educator out there. There's some great ones out there, especially on YouTube (Brad Traversy, Cody Schafer, etc). I think it's because the best, fastest, and most pleasant way to learn to code is to apply it to something you enjoy and can be useful to you right away. For example, most beginner machine learning with Python courses introduce you to predictive analysis by having you predict housing prices. That's fine, but wouldn't it be more interesting and engaging to get introduced to predictive analysis by predicting WR fantasy football performance? 

With this in mind, each section of my course has some sort of fantasy football focus, all along the way introducing you to more and more complex programming/data science topics. My course walks you through the set up of Python, all the way to writing machine learning models to rank players in to tiers for fantasy football. It comes with 16 sections of material, 14 hours of video, and access to a Slack channel where you can personally ask me questions when you get stuck (I work from home, so I usually respond within a couple minutes to 2 days max).

Anyway - you all have been super supportive of my content [since my first ever post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/en8xte/guide_to_setting_up_python_for_fantasy_football/), so I figure why not do a giveaway to mark the end of the season! 

**Just upvote and comment anything below, and I'll randomly select three people to get free lifetime access to the course.**

Edit:

I'll make the selection at 10PM EST tonight and post the results at the bottom here. If you win, I'll also be sending you a PM on how to access the course!

Also, some people already ordered. If you want to order it already that's cool, you'll get a full refund if you're randomly selected by the draw. You'll just have to let me know after what email you used at checkout.

Edit #2 (winners selected!): 

Congrats to the following lucky redditors. And thanks to everyone for entering, you guys are awesome!!

s67clq	Learn Python with Fantasy Football Giveaway!	NukishPhilosophy	2022-01-17 16:01:34	"Hi everyone,

This is the second giveaway I'm doing for a course I teach on learning Python with Fantasy Football!

**[Link to the course](https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com/)**

**Upvote and comment anything below to enter! Winners will be randomly chosen after the Rams-Cardinals game tonight** 

Below is what I wrote last year when I did this same giveaway with a brief description of what the course is about, why I made it, and what makes it different than your average programming course (the feedback last year was so amazing with close to 5000 entries that we're doing 10 winners this year):

For those that don't know, Python is a beginner-friendly programming language that's really popular for data analysis. As a first programming language, it's a perfect fit for a beginner who wants to learn a programming language and is obsessed with fantasy football.

Anyway - you all have been super supportive of my content since my first ever post here, so I figure why not do a giveaway to mark the end of the season!

Just upvote and comment anything below, and I'll randomly select (with a python script, of course :)) ten people to get free lifetime access to the course.

Just as last year, I'll make the selection tonight and post the results at the bottom here. If you win, I'll also be sending you a PM on how to access the course!

Also, some people will want to order before the giveaway is over. If you want to order it already that's cool, you'll get a full refund if you're randomly selected by the draw. You'll just have to let me know after what email you used at checkout.

**Winners are posted below. Thank you to everyone who participated in the giveaway!!**
