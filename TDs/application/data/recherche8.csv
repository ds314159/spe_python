"Improved transfer efficiency with pulsed atom transfer between two
  magneto-optical traps"	S P Ram	S K Tiwari, S R Mishra	2010-03-29 12:17:54	In our double magneto-optical trap (MOT) setup containing a vapor chamber MOT (VC-MOT) and an ultra high vacuum MOT (UHV-MOT) for $^{87}$Rb atoms, we find that transfer of atoms from VC-MOT to UHV-MOT can be enhanced by employing a pulsed VC-MOT loading followed by a pulsed push beam, as compared to that obtained by focusing a continuous wave (CW) push beam on a continuously loaded VC-MOT. By choosing appropriately the VC-MOT duration and push beam duration, the number of atoms in UHV-MOT was $\sim$3-times the number obtained with a continuous VC-MOT and a CW push beam of optimized power. The processes affecting the pulsed transfer have been studied.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5519v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
3D Multi-Object Tracking: A Baseline and New Evaluation Metrics	Xinshuo Weng	Jianren Wang, David Held, Kris Kitani	2019-07-09 03:26:21	3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is an essential component for many applications such as autonomous driving and assistive robotics. Recent work on 3D MOT focuses on developing accurate systems giving less attention to practical considerations such as computational cost and system complexity. In contrast, this work proposes a simple real-time 3D MOT system. Our system first obtains 3D detections from a LiDAR point cloud. Then, a straightforward combination of a 3D Kalman filter and the Hungarian algorithm is used for state estimation and data association. Additionally, 3D MOT datasets such as KITTI evaluate MOT methods in the 2D space and standardized 3D MOT evaluation tools are missing for a fair comparison of 3D MOT methods. Therefore, we propose a new 3D MOT evaluation tool along with three new metrics to comprehensively evaluate 3D MOT methods. We show that, although our system employs a combination of classical MOT modules, we achieve state-of-the-art 3D MOT performance on two 3D MOT benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes). Surprisingly, although our system does not use any 2D data as inputs, we achieve competitive performance on the KITTI 2D MOT leaderboard. Our proposed system runs at a rate of $207.4$ FPS on the KITTI dataset, achieving the fastest speed among all modern MOT systems. To encourage standardized 3D MOT evaluation, our system and evaluation code are made publicly available at https://github.com/xinshuoweng/AB3DMOT.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03961v5	cs	arxiv					0.0

DG-Labeler and DGL-MOTS Dataset: Boost the Autonomous Driving Perception	Yiming Cui	Zhiwen Cao, Yixin Xie, Xingyu Jiang, Feng Tao, Yingjie Chen, Lin Li, Dongfang Liu	2021-10-15 01:04:31	Multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS) is a critical task for autonomous driving applications. The existing MOTS studies face two critical challenges: 1) the published datasets inadequately capture the real-world complexity for network training to address various driving settings; 2) the working pipeline annotation tool is under-studied in the literature to improve the quality of MOTS learning examples. In this work, we introduce the DG-Labeler and DGL-MOTS dataset to facilitate the training data annotation for the MOTS task and accordingly improve network training accuracy and efficiency. DG-Labeler uses the novel Depth-Granularity Module to depict the instance spatial relations and produce fine-grained instance masks. Annotated by DG-Labeler, our DGL-MOTS dataset exceeds the prior effort (i.e., KITTI MOTS and BDD100K) in data diversity, annotation quality, and temporal representations. Results on extensive cross-dataset evaluations indicate significant performance improvements for several state-of-the-art methods trained on our DGL-MOTS dataset. We believe our DGL-MOTS Dataset and DG-Labeler hold the valuable potential to boost the visual perception of future transportation.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07790v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Monotonicity Preserving Transformations of MOT and SEP	Martin Huesmann	Florian Stebegg	2016-09-14 00:54:33	Recently, \cite{BeJu16, BeNuTo16} established that optimizers to the martingale optimal transport problem (MOT) are concentrated on $c$-monotone sets. In this article we characterize monotonicity preserving transformations revealing certain symmetries between optimizers of MOT for different cost functions. Due to the intimate connection of MOT and the Skorokhod embedding problem (SEP) these transformations are also monotonicity preserving and disclose symmetries for certain solutions to the optimal SEP. Furthermore, the SEP picture allows to easily understand the geometry of these transformations once we have established the SEP counterparts to the known solutions of MOT based on the monotonicity principle for SEP which in turn allows to directly read off the structure of the MOT optimizers.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spa.2017.07.005	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The influence of optical molasses in loading a shallow optical trap	Mathew S. Hamilton	Anthony R. Gorges, Jacob L. Roberts	2008-11-04 01:04:07	We have examined loading of 85Rb atoms into a shallow Far-Off-Resonance Trap (FORT) from an optical molasses and compared it to loading from a Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT). We found that substantially more atoms could be loaded into the FORT via an optical molasses as compared to loading from the MOT alone. To determine why this was the case, we measured the rate of atoms loaded into the FORT and the losses from the FORT during the loading process. For both MOT and molasses loading, we examined atom load rate and losses over a range of detunings as well as hyperfine pump powers. We found that the losses induced during MOT loading were essentially the same as the losses induced during molasses loading at the same MOT/molasses detuning. In contrast, load rate of the molasses was higher than that of a MOT at a given detuning. This caused the optical molasses to be able to load more atoms than the MOT. Optimization of FORT loading form an optical molasses improved the number of atoms we could trap by a factor of two over that of optimal loading from a MOT.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.79.013418	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A misaligned magneto-optical trap to enable miniaturized atom chip
  systems"	Ritayan Roy	Jo Rushton, Andrei Dragomir, Matthew Aldous, Matt Himsworth	2018-02-15 13:37:17	We describe the application of displaced, or misaligned, beams in a mirror-based magneto-optical trap (MOT) to enable portable and miniaturized atom chip experiments, where optical access is limited to a single window. Two different geometries of beam displacement are investigated: a variation on the well-known 'vortex-MOT', and the other a novel 'hybrid-MOT' combining Zeeman-shifted and purely optical scattering force components. The beam geometry is obtained similar to the mirror-MOT, using a planar mirror surface but with a different magnetic field geometry more suited to planar systems. Using these techniques, we have trapped around 6$\times 10^6$ and 26$\times 10^6$atoms of $^{85}$Rb in the vortex-MOT and hybrid-MOT respectively. For the vortex-MOT the atoms are directly cooled well below the Doppler temperature without any additional sub-Doppler cooling stage, whereas the temperature of the hybrid-MOT has been measured slightly above the Doppler temperature limit. In both cases the attained lower temperature ensures the quantum behaviour of the trapped atoms required for the applications of portable quantum sensors and many others.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05525v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Characteristics of unconventional Rb magneto-optical traps	K. N. Jarvis	B. E. Sauer, M. R. Tarbutt	2018-07-19 22:19:28	We study several new magneto-optical trapping configurations in $^{87}$Rb. These unconventional MOTs all use type-II transitions, where the angular momentum of the ground state is greater than or equal to that of the excited state, and they may use either red-detuned or blue-detuned light. We describe the conditions under which each new MOT forms. The various MOTs exhibit an enormous range of lifetimes, temperatures and density distributions. At the detunings where they are maximized, the lifetimes of the various MOTs vary from 0.1 to 15 s. One MOT forms large ring-like structures with no density at the centre. The temperature in the red-detuned MOTs can be three orders of magnitude higher than in the blue-detuned MOTs. We present measurements of the capture velocity of a blue-detuned MOT, and we study how the loss rate due to ultracold collisions depends on laser intensity and detuning.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.98.043432	cs	arxiv					0.0	
On the Stability of MOTS	Albert Huber	Aucun	2021-04-13 18:50:33	In this paper, it is shown (using the NP-spin coefficient formalism) that the MOTS eigenvalue problem can be formulated - for certain classes of geometric models in GR - such that the MOTS stability operator takes a self-adjoint form, despite being a manifestly non-self-adjoint differential operator. This form is obtained by performing a suitable null rotation, which is chosen so that the MOTS under consideration remain such, i.e., transition into new MOTS. Next to the requirement that certain components of the Einstein tensor - resp. the stress-energy tensor - be zero, the main prerequisite for bringing the MOTS operator into the required form is the existence of a non-expanding null horizon together with a set of eigenfunctions of the MOTS operator that does not change along the Lie flow of the generator of said horizon. For illustration, the developed method is applied to the Kerr-Newman family of spacetimes.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06451v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Horizon area bound and MOTS stability in locally rotationally symmetric
  solutions"	Abbas M. Sherif	Peter K. S. Dunsby	2022-09-23 01:04:37	"In this paper, we study the stability of marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS), foliating horizons of the form $r=X(\tau)$, embedded in locally rotationally symmetric class II perfect fluid spacetimes. An upper bound on the area of stable MOTS is obtained. It is shown that any stable MOTS of the types considered in these spacetimes must be strictly stably outermost, that is, there are no MOTS ``outside"" of and homologous to $\mathcal{S}$. Aspects of the topology of the MOTS, as well as the case when an extension is made to imperfect fluids, are discussed. Some non-existence results are also obtained. Finally, the ``growth"" of certain matter and curvature quantities on certain unstable MOTS are provided under specified conditions."	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/acb195	cs	arxiv					0.0	
ReIDTrack: Multi-Object Track and Segmentation Without Motion	Kaer Huang	Bingchuan Sun, Feng Chen, Tao Zhang, Jun Xie, Jian Li, Christopher Walter Twombly, Zhepeng Wang	2023-08-03 08:53:23	In recent years, dominant Multi-object tracking (MOT) and segmentation (MOTS) methods mainly follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm. Transformer-based end-to-end (E2E) solutions bring some ideas to MOT and MOTS, but they cannot achieve a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in major MOT and MOTS benchmarks. Detection and association are two main modules of the tracking-by-detection paradigm. Association techniques mainly depend on the combination of motion and appearance information. As deep learning has been recently developed, the performance of the detection and appearance model is rapidly improved. These trends made us consider whether we can achieve SOTA based on only high-performance detection and appearance model. Our paper mainly focuses on exploring this direction based on CBNetV2 with Swin-B as a detection model and MoCo-v2 as a self-supervised appearance model. Motion information and IoU mapping were removed during the association. Our method wins 1st place on the MOTS track and wins 2nd on the MOT track in the CVPR2023 WAD workshop. We hope our simple and effective method can give some insights to the MOT and MOTS research community.

Atomic fountain of laser-cooled Yb atoms for precision measurements	Kanhaiya Pandey	K. D. Rathod, Alok K. Singh, Vasant Natarajan	2010-08-19 06:28:43	We demonstrate launching of laser-cooled Yb atoms in a cold atomic fountain. Atoms in a collimated thermal beam are first cooled and captured in a magneto-optic trap (MOT) operating on the strongly-allowed ${^1S}_0 \rightarrow {^1P}_1$ transition at 399~nm (blue line). They are then transferred to a MOT on the weakly-allowed ${^1S}_0 \rightarrow {^3P}_1$ transition at 556~nm (green line). Cold atoms from the green MOT are launched against gravity at a velocity of around 2.5~m/s using a pair of green beams. We trap more than $10^7$ atoms in the blue MOT and transfer up to 70\% into the green MOT. The temperature for the odd isotope, $^{171}$Yb, is $\sim$1~mK in the blue MOT, and reduces by a factor of 40 in the green MOT.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.82.043429	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Enhancing the capture velocity of a Dy magneto-optical trap with
  two-stage slowing"	William Lunden	Li Du, Michael Cantara, Pierre Barral, Alan O. Jamison, Wolfgang Ketterle	2019-08-27 19:47:51	Magneto-optical traps (MOTs) based on the $626\;{\rm nm}$, $136\;{\rm kHz}$-wide intercombination line of Dy, which has an attractively low Doppler temperature of $3.3\;\mu{\rm K}$, have been implemented in a growing number of experiments over the last several years. A challenge in loading these MOTs comes from their low capture velocities. Slowed atomic beams can spread out significantly during free-flight from the Zeeman slower to the MOT position, reducing the fraction of the beam captured by the MOT. Here we apply, for the first time in a Dy experiment, a scheme for enhancing the loading rate of the MOT wherein atoms are Zeeman-slowed to a final velocity larger than the MOT's capture velocity, and then undergo a final stage of slowing by a pair of near-detuned beams addressing the $421\;{\rm nm}$ transition directly in front of the MOT. By reducing the free-flight time of the Zeeman-slowed atomic beam, we greatly enhance the slowed flux delivered to the MOT, leading to more than an order of magnitude enhancement in the final MOT population.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.101.063403	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Collaborative Multi-Object Tracking with Conformal Uncertainty
  Propagation"	Sanbao Su	Songyang Han, Yiming Li, Zhili Zhang, Chen Feng, Caiwen Ding, Fei Miao	2023-03-25 03:32:01	Object detection and multiple object tracking (MOT) are essential components of self-driving systems. Accurate detection and uncertainty quantification are both critical for onboard modules, such as perception, prediction, and planning, to improve the safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles. Collaborative object detection (COD) has been proposed to improve detection accuracy and reduce uncertainty by leveraging the viewpoints of multiple agents. However, little attention has been paid on how to leverage the uncertainty quantification from COD to enhance MOT performance. In this paper, as the first attempt, we design the uncertainty propagation framework to address this challenge, called MOT-CUP. Our framework first quantifies the uncertainty of COD through direct modeling and conformal prediction, and propogates this uncertainty information during the motion prediction and association steps. MOT-CUP is designed to work with different collaborative object detectors and baseline MOT algorithms. We evaluate MOT-CUP on V2X-Sim, a comprehensive collaborative perception dataset, and demonstrate a 2% improvement in accuracy and a 2.67X reduction in uncertainty compared to the baselines, e.g., SORT and ByteTrack. MOT-CUP demonstrates the importance of uncertainty quantification in both COD and MOT, and provides the first attempt to improve the accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in MOT based on COD through uncertainty propogation.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14346v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Dysprosium magneto-optical traps	Seo Ho Youn	Mingwu Lu, Ushnish Ray, Benjamin L.

We recently reported the first MOTs of the five high abundance isotopes of the most magnetic atom, dysprosium. Described here are details of the experimental technique employed for repumper-free Dy MOTs containing up to half a billion atoms. Extensive characterization of the MOTs' properties---population, temperature, loading, metastable decay dynamics, trap dynamics---is provided.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.82.043425	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A compact high-flux cold atom beam source	J. R. Kellogg	D. Schlippert, J. M. Kohel, R. J. Thompson, D. C. Aveline, N. Yu	2011-07-27 22:37:22	We report on an efficient and compact high-flux Cs atom beam source based on a retro-reflected two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D MOT). We realize an effective pushing field component by tilting the 2D MOT collimators towards a separate three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (3D MOT) in ultra-high vacuum. This technique significantly improved 3D MOT loading rates to greater than $8 \times 10^9$ atoms/s using only 20 mW of total laser power for the source. When operating below saturation, we achieve a maximum efficiency of $6.2 \times 10^{11}$ atoms/s/W.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00340-012-5220-5	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Novel, Retroreflective, Magneto-Optical Trap Near a Surface	Jonathan Trossman	Zigeng Liu, Ming-Feng Tu, Selim Shariar, Brian Odom, J. B. Ketterson	2015-10-27 20:17:45	We report on a novel Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT) geometry involving the retroreflection of one of the six MOT beams in order to create an atom cloud close to the surface of a prism which does not have optical access along one axis. A MOT of Rb$^{85}$ with $\sim 4 \times 10^7$ atoms can be created 700 um from the surface. The MOT lies close to the minimum of an evanescent Gravito-Optical Surface Trap (GOST) allowing for transfer into the GOST with potentially minimal losses.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08081v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"RT-MOT: Confidence-Aware Real-Time Scheduling Framework for Multi-Object
  Tracking Tasks"	Donghwa Kang	Seunghoon Lee, Hoon Sung Chwa, Seung-Hwan Bae, Chang Mook Kang, Jinkyu Lee, Hyeongboo Baek	2022-10-19 14:31:19	Different from existing MOT (Multi-Object Tracking) techniques that usually aim at improving tracking accuracy and average FPS, real-time systems such as autonomous vehicles necessitate new requirements of MOT under limited computing resources: (R1) guarantee of timely execution and (R2) high tracking accuracy. In this paper, we propose RT-MOT, a novel system design for multiple MOT tasks, which addresses R1 and R2. Focusing on multiple choices of a workload pair of detection and association, which are two main components of the tracking-by-detection approach for MOT, we tailor a measure of object confidence for RT-MOT and develop how to estimate the measure for the next frame of each MOT task. By utilizing the estimation, we make it possible to predict tracking accuracy variation according to different workload pairs to be applied to the next frame of an MOT task. Next, we develop a novel confidence-aware real-time scheduling framework, which offers an offline timing guarantee for a set of MOT tasks based on non-preemptive fixed-priority scheduling with the smallest workload pair. At run-time, the framework checks the feasibility of a priority-inversion associated with a larger workload pair, which does not compromise the timing guarantee of every task, and then chooses a feasible scenario that yields the largest tracking accuracy improvement based on the proposed prediction. Our experiment results demonstrate that RT-MOT significantly improves overall tracking accuracy by up to 1.5x, compared to existing popular tracking-by-detection approaches, while guaranteeing timely execution of all MOT tasks.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11946v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"On the geodesic incompleteness of spacetimes containing marginally outer
  trapped surfaces"	I. P. Costa e Silva	Aucun	2012-07-04 20:06:05	In a recent paper, Eichmair, Galloway and Pollack have proved a Gannon-Lee-type singularity theorem based on the existence of marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS) on noncompact initial data sets for globally hyperbolic spacetimes. This result requires that the MOTS be generic in a suitable sense. In the same spirit, this author has proven some variants of that result which hold for weaker causal conditions on spacetime, but which concern (generic) marginally trapped surfaces (MTS) rather than MOTS, i.e., most of the results need a condition on the convergence of the ingoing family of normal null geodesics as well. However, much of the more recent literature has focused on MOTS rather than MTS as quasi-local substitutes for the description of black holes, as they are arguably more natural and easier to handle in a number of situations. It is therefore pertinent to ask to what extent one can deduce the existence of singularities in the presence of MOTS alone. In this note, we address this issue and show that singularities still arise in the presence of generic MOTS under weaker causal conditions (specifically, for causally simple spacetimes). Moreover, provided we assume that the MOTS is the boundary of a compact spatial region, a Penrose-Hawking-type singularity theorem can be established for chronological spacetimes containing generic MOTS.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/29/23/235008	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Model-independent measurements of the sodium magneto-optical trap's
  excited-state population"	J. M. Kwolek	D. S. Goodman, S. A. Entner, J. E. Wells, F. A. Narducci, W. W. Smith	2018-02-14 20:09:47	We present model-independent measurements of the excited-state population of atoms in a sodium (Na) magneto-optical trap (MOT) using a hybrid ion-neutral trap composed of a MOT and a linear Paul trap (LPT). We photoionize excited Na atoms trapped in the MOT and use two independent methods to measure the resulting ions: directly by trapping them in our LPT, and indirectly by monitoring changes in MOT fluorescence. By measuring the ionization rate via these two independent methods, we have enough information to directly determine the population of MOT atoms in the excited-state. The resulting measurement reveals that there is a range of trapping-laser intensities where the excited-state population of atoms in our MOT follows the standard two-level model intensity-dependence. However, an experimentally determined effective saturation intensity must be used instead of the theoretically predicted value from the two-level model. We measured the effective saturation intensity to be $I_\mathrm{se}=22.9(3)\:\textrm{mW}/\textrm{cm}^2$ for the type-I Na MOT and $I_\mathrm{se}=48.9(7)\;\textrm{mW}/\textrm{cm}^2$ for the type-II Na MOT, approximately 1.7 and 3.6 times the theoretical estimate, respectively. Lastly, at large trapping-laser intensities, our experiment reveals a clear departure from the two-level model at a critical intensity that we believe is due to a state-mixing effect, whose critical intensity can be determined by a simple power broadening model.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.97.053420	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Towards Real-Time Multi-Object Tracking	Zhongdao Wang	Liang Zheng, Yixuan Liu, Yali Li, Shengjin Wang	2019-09-27 10:35:23	Modern multiple object tracking (MOT) systems usually follow the \emph{tracking-by-detection} paradigm. It has 1) a detection model for target localization and 2) an appearance embedding model for data association. Having the two models separately executed might lead to efficiency problems, as the running time is simply a sum of the two steps without investigating potential structures that can be shared between them. Existing research efforts on real-time MOT usually focus on the association step, so they are essentially real-time association methods but not real-time MOT system. In this paper, we propose an MOT system that allows target detection and appearance embedding to be learned in a shared model. Specifically, we incorporate the appearance embedding model into a single-shot detector, such that the model can simultaneously output detections and the corresponding embeddings. We further propose a simple and fast association method that works in conjunction with the joint model. In both components the computation cost is significantly reduced compared with former MOT systems, resulting in a neat and fast baseline for future follow-ups on real-time MOT algorithm design. To our knowledge, this work reports the first (near) real-time MOT system, with a running speed of 22 to 40 FPS depending on the input resolution. Meanwhile, its tracking accuracy is comparable to the state-of-the-art trackers embodying separate detection and embedding (SDE) learning ($64.4\%$ MOTA \vs $66.1\%$ MOTA on MOT-16 challenge).

Magnetic trapping of a cold Rb-Cs atomic mixture	M. L. Harris	P. Tierney, S. L. Cornish	2007-11-16 12:50:48	We present an apparatus for the study of an ultracold gaseous atomic mixture of 133Cs and 87Rb. The mixture is prepared using a double magneto-optical trap (MOT) system in which a two-species pyramid MOT acts as a source of cold atoms for a `science' MOT. Measurements of the interspecies trap loss rate coefficients beta_RbCs and beta_CsRb in the science MOT are reported. After the initial MOT phase, atoms in the mixture are optically pumped into the magnetically trappable |F=3,m_F=-3> and |F=1,m_F=-1> states of Cs and Rb (respectively) and loaded into an Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic trap. We demonstrate a novel technique for limiting the interspecies loss rate in the science MOT by spatially separating the two trapped atom clouds, which greatly enhances the number of atoms which can be loaded into the magnetic trap.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-4075/41/3/035303	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Recent Advances in Embedding Methods for Multi-Object Tracking: A Survey	Gaoang Wang	Mingli Song, Jenq-Neng Hwang	2022-05-22 06:54:33	Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to associate target objects across video frames in order to obtain entire moving trajectories. With the advancement of deep neural networks and the increasing demand for intelligent video analysis, MOT has gained significantly increased interest in the computer vision community. Embedding methods play an essential role in object location estimation and temporal identity association in MOT. Unlike other computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, re-identification, and segmentation, embedding methods in MOT have large variations, and they have never been systematically analyzed and summarized. In this survey, we first conduct a comprehensive overview with in-depth analysis for embedding methods in MOT from seven different perspectives, including patch-level embedding, single-frame embedding, cross-frame joint embedding, correlation embedding, sequential embedding, tracklet embedding, and cross-track relational embedding. We further summarize the existing widely used MOT datasets and analyze the advantages of existing state-of-the-art methods according to their embedding strategies. Finally, some critical yet under-investigated areas and future research directions are discussed.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10766v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Towards improved loading, cooling, and trapping of molecules in
  magneto-optical traps"	Thomas K. Langin	David DeMille	2022-10-25 17:59:57	Recent experiments have demonstrated direct cooling and trapping of diatomic and triatomic molecules in magneto-optical traps (MOTs). However, even the best molecular MOTs to date still have density $10^{-5}$ times smaller than in typical atomic MOTs. The main limiting factors are: (i) inefficiencies in slowing molecules to velocities low enough to be captured by the MOT, (ii) low MOT capture velocities, and (iii) limits on density within the MOT resulting from sub-Doppler heating~[J. A. Devlin and M. R. Tarbutt, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{90}, 063415 (2018)]. All of these are consequences of the need to drive `Type-II' optical cycling transitions, where dark states appear in Zeeman sublevels, in order to avoid rotational branching. We present simulations demonstrating ways to mitigate each of these limitations. This should pave the way towards loading molecules into conservative traps with sufficiently high density and number to evaporatively cool them to quantum degeneracy.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/acc34d	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"MotionTrack: End-to-End Transformer-based Multi-Object Tracing with
  LiDAR-Camera Fusion"	Ce Zhang	Chengjie Zhang, Yiluan Guo, Lingji Chen, Michael Happold	2023-06-29 15:00:12	Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is crucial to autonomous vehicle perception. End-to-end transformer-based algorithms, which detect and track objects simultaneously, show great potential for the MOT task. However, most existing methods focus on image-based tracking with a single object category. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end transformer-based MOT algorithm (MotionTrack) with multi-modality sensor inputs to track objects with multiple classes. Our objective is to establish a transformer baseline for the MOT in an autonomous driving environment. The proposed algorithm consists of a transformer-based data association (DA) module and a transformer-based query enhancement module to achieve MOT and Multiple Object Detection (MOD) simultaneously. The MotionTrack and its variations achieve better results (AMOTA score at 0.55) on the nuScenes dataset compared with other classical baseline models, such as the AB3DMOT, the CenterTrack, and the probabilistic 3D Kalman filter. In addition, we prove that a modified attention mechanism can be utilized for DA to accomplish the MOT, and aggregate history features to enhance the MOD performance.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17000v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A Blue-Detuned Magneto-Optical Trap of CaF Molecules	Samuel J. Li	Connor M. Holland, Yukai Lu, Lawrence W. Cheuk	2023-11-09 15:34:53	A key method to produce trapped and laser-cooled molecules is the magneto-optical trap (MOT), which is conventionally created using light red-detuned from an optical transition. In this work, we report a MOT for CaF molecules created using blue-detuned light. The blue-detuned MOT (BDM) achieves temperatures well below the Doppler limit, and provides the highest densities and phase-space densities reported to date in CaF MOTs. We observe short BDM lifetimes at high magnetic field gradients, preventing magnetic compression as a means to increase densities. By directly measuring the BDM restoring force, we find that the short lifetimes are explained by low effective trap depths. Notably, we find sub-mK depths at typical magnetic gradients, in contrast to $\sim 50\,\text{mK}$ depths in red molecular MOTs and $\sim0.5\,\text{K}$ depths in red atomic MOTs.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05447v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Polynomial-time algorithms for Multimarginal Optimal Transport problems
  with structure"	Jason M. Altschuler	Enric Boix-Adsera	2020-08-07 06:24:22	"Multimarginal Optimal Transport (MOT) has attracted significant interest due to applications in machine learning, statistics, and the sciences. However, in most applications, the success of MOT is severely limited by a lack of efficient algorithms. Indeed, MOT in general requires exponential time in the number of marginals k and their support sizes n. This paper develops a general theory about what ""structure"" makes MOT solvable in poly(n,k) time.   We develop a unified algorithmic framework for solving MOT in poly(n,k) time by characterizing the ""structure"" that different algorithms require in terms of simple variants of the dual feasibility oracle. This framework has several benefits. First, it enables us to show that the Sinkhorn algorithm, which is currently the most popular MOT algorithm, requires strictly more structure than other algorithms do to solve MOT in poly(n,k) time. Second, our framework makes it much simpler to develop poly(n,k) time algorithms for a given MOT problem. In particular, it is necessary and sufficient to (approximately) solve the dual feasibility oracle -- which is much more amenable to standard algorithmic techniques.   We illustrate this ease-of-use by developing poly(n,k) time algorithms for three general classes of MOT cost structures: (1) graphical structure; (2) set-optimization structure; and (3) low-rank plus sparse structure. For structure (1), we recover the known result that Sinkhorn has poly(n,k) runtime; moreover, we provide the first poly(n,k) time algorithms for computing solutions that are exact and sparse. For structures (2)-(3), we give the first poly(n,k) time algorithms, even for approximate computation. Together, these three structures encompass many -- if not most -- current applications of MOT."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03006v4	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Continuous loading of cold atoms into a Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic trap	Piet O. Schmidt	Sven Hensler, Joerg Werner, Thomas Binhammer, Axel Goerlitz, Tilman Pfau	2002-11-06 20:41:01	We present a robust continuous optical loading scheme for a Ioffe-Pritchard (IP) type magnetic trap. Atoms are cooled and trapped in a modified magneto-optical trap (MOT) consisting of a conventional 2D-MOT in radial direction and an axial molasses. The radial magnetic field gradient needed for the operation of the 2D-MOT is provided by the IP trap. A small axial curvature and offset field provide magnetic confinement and suppress spin-flip losses in the center of the magnetic trap without altering the performance of the 2D-MOT. Continuous loading of atoms into the IP trap is provided by radiative leakage from the MOT to a metastable level which is magnetically trapped and decoupled from the MOT light. We are able to accumulate 30 times more atoms in the magnetic trap than in the MOT. The absolute number of $2\times 10^8$~atoms is limited by inelastic collisions. A model based on rate equations shows good agreement with our data. Our scheme can also be applied to other atoms with similar level structure like alkaline earth metals.	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211032v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"UA-DETRAC: A New Benchmark and Protocol for Multi-Object Detection and
  Tracking"	Longyin Wen	Dawei Du, Zhaowei Cai, Zhen Lei, Ming-Ching Chang, Honggang Qi, Jongwoo Lim, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Siwei Lyu	2015-11-13 01:37:39	In recent years, numerous effective multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are developed because of the wide range of applications. Existing performance evaluations of MOT methods usually separate the object tracking step from the object detection step by using the same fixed object detection results for comparisons. In this work, we perform a comprehensive quantitative study on the effects of object detection accuracy to the overall MOT performance, using the new large-scale University at Albany DETection and tRACking (UA-DETRAC) benchmark dataset. The UA-DETRAC benchmark dataset consists of 100 challenging video sequences captured from real-world traffic scenes (over 140,000 frames with rich annotations, including occlusion, weather, vehicle category, truncation, and vehicle bounding boxes) for object detection, object tracking and MOT system. We evaluate complete MOT systems constructed from combinations of state-of-the-art object detection and object tracking methods. Our analysis shows the complex effects of object detection accuracy on MOT system performance. Based on these observations, we propose new evaluation tools and metrics for MOT systems that consider both object detection and object tracking for comprehensive analysis.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04136v4	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Characteristics of a magneto-optical trap of molecules	H. J. Williams	S. Truppe, M. Hambach, L. Caldwell, N. J. Fitch, E. A. Hinds, B. E. Sauer, M. R. Tarbutt	2017-06-23 19:35:45	We present the properties of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of CaF molecules. We study the process of loading the MOT from a decelerated buffer-gas-cooled beam, and how best to slow this molecular beam in order to capture the most molecules. We determine how the number of molecules, the photon scattering rate, the oscillation frequency, damping constant, temperature, cloud size and lifetime depend on the key parameters of the MOT, especially the intensity and detuning of the main cooling laser. We compare our results to analytical and numerical models, to the properties of standard atomic MOTs, and to MOTs of SrF molecules. We load up to $2 \times 10^4$ molecules, and measure a maximum scattering rate of $2.5 \times 10^6$ s$^{-1}$ per molecule, a maximum oscillation frequency of 100 Hz, a maximum damping constant of 500 s$^{-1}$, and a minimum MOT rms radius of 1.5 mm. A minimum temperature of 730 $\mu$K is obtained by ramping down the laser intensity to low values. The lifetime, typically about 100 ms, is consistent with a leak out of the cooling cycle with a branching ratio of about $6 \times 10^{-6}$. The MOT has a capture velocity of about 11 m/s.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/aa8e52	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Towards Understanding Man-on-the-Side Attacks (MotS) in SCADA Networks	Peter Maynard	Kieran McLaughlin	2020-04-29 17:06:59	"We describe a new class of packet injection attacks called Man-on-the-Side Attacks (MotS), previously only seen where state actors have ""compromised"" a number of telecommunication companies. MotS injection attacks have not been widely investigated in scientific literature, despite having been discussed by news outlets and security blogs. MotS came to attention after the Edward Snowden revelations, which described large scale pervasive monitoring of the Internet's infrastructure. For an advanced adversary attempting to interfere with IT connected systems, the next logical step is to adapt this class of attack to a smaller scale, such as enterprise or critical infrastructure networks. MotS is a weaker form of attack compared to a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM). A MotS attack allows an adversary to read and inject packets, but not modify packets sent by other hosts. This paper presents practical experiments where we have implemented and performed MotS attacks against two testbeds: 1) on HTTP connections, by redirecting a victim to a host controlled by an adversary; and 2) on an Industrial Control network, where we inject falsified command responses to the victim. In both cases, the victims accept the injected packets without generating a suspiciously large number of unusual packets on the network. We then perform an analysis of three leading Network IDS to determine whether the attacks are detected, and discuss mitigation methods."	http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14334v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Hardness results for Multimarginal Optimal Transport problems	Jason M. Altschuler	Enric Boix-Adsera	2020-12-10 01:36:12	Multimarginal Optimal Transport (MOT) is the problem of linear programming over joint probability distributions with fixed marginals. A key issue in many applications is the complexity of solving MOT: the linear program has exponential size in the number of marginals k and their support sizes n. A recent line of work has shown that MOT is poly(n,k)-time solvable for certain families of costs that have poly(n,k)-size implicit representations. However, it is unclear what further families of costs this line of algorithmic research can encompass. In order to understand these fundamental limitations, this paper initiates the study of intractability results for MOT.   Our main technical contribution is developing a toolkit for proving NP-hardness and inapproximability results for MOT problems. We demonstrate this toolkit by using it to establish the intractability of a number of MOT problems studied in the literature that have resisted previous algorithmic efforts. For instance, we provide evidence that repulsive costs make MOT intractable by showing that several such problems of interest are NP-hard to solve--even approximately.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.disopt.2021.100669	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Robust Unsupervised Multi-Object Tracking in Noisy Environments	C. -H. Huck Yang	Mohit Chhabra, Y. -C. Liu, Quan Kong, Tomoaki Yoshinaga, Tomokazu Murakami	2021-05-20 19:38:03	Physical processes, camera movement, and unpredictable environmental conditions like the presence of dust can induce noise and artifacts in video feeds. We observe that popular unsupervised MOT methods are dependent on noise-free inputs. We show that the addition of a small amount of artificial random noise causes a sharp degradation in model performance on benchmark metrics. We resolve this problem by introducing a robust unsupervised multi-object tracking (MOT) model: AttU-Net. The proposed single-head attention model helps limit the negative impact of noise by learning visual representations at different segment scales. AttU-Net shows better unsupervised MOT tracking performance over variational inference-based state-of-the-art baselines. We evaluate our method in the MNIST-MOT and the Atari game video benchmark. We also provide two extended video datasets: ``Kuzushiji-MNIST MOT'' which consists of moving Japanese characters and ``Fashion-MNIST MOT'' to validate the effectiveness of the MOT models.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICIP42928.2021.9506029	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Tracklet-Switch Adversarial Attack against Pedestrian Multi-Object
  Tracking Trackers"	Delv Lin	Qi Chen, Chengyu Zhou, Kun He	2021-11-17 07:53:45	Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has achieved aggressive progress and derived many excellent deep learning trackers. Meanwhile, most deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples that are crafted with small perturbations but could mislead the model prediction. In this work, we observe that the robustness on the MOT trackers is rarely studied, and it is challenging to attack the MOT system since its mature association algorithms are designed to be robust against errors during the tracking. To this end, we analyze the vulnerability of popular MOT trackers and propose a novel adversarial attack method called Tracklet-Switch (TraSw) against the complete tracking pipeline of MOT. The proposed TraSw can fool the advanced deep pedestrian trackers (i.e., FairMOT and ByteTrack), causing them fail to track the targets in the subsequent frames by perturbing very few frames. Experiments on the MOT-Challenge datasets (i.e., 2DMOT15, MOT17, and MOT20) show that TraSw can achieve an extraordinarily high success attack rate of over 95% by attacking only four frames on average. To our knowledge, this is the first work on the adversarial attack against the pedestrian MOT trackers. Code is available at https://github.com/JHL-HUST/TraSw .	http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08954v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Neural Enhanced Belief Propagation for Multiobject Tracking	Mingchao Liang	Florian Meyer	2022-12-16 08:31:07	Algorithmic solutions for multi-object tracking (MOT) are a key enabler for applications in autonomous navigation and applied ocean sciences. State-of-the-art MOT methods fully rely on a statistical model and typically use preprocessed sensor data as measurements. In particular, measurements are produced by a detector that extracts potential object locations from the raw sensor data collected for a discrete time step. This preparatory processing step reduces data flow and computational complexity but may result in a loss of information. State-of-the-art Bayesian MOT methods that are based on belief propagation (BP) systematically exploit graph structures of the statistical model to reduce computational complexity and improve scalability. However, as a fully model-based approach, BP can only provide suboptimal estimates when there is a mismatch between the statistical model and the true data-generating process. Existing BP-based MOT methods can further only make use of preprocessed measurements. In this paper, we introduce a variant of BP that combines model-based with data-driven MOT. The proposed neural enhanced belief propagation (NEBP) method complements the statistical model of BP by information learned from raw sensor data. This approach conjectures that the learned information can reduce model mismatch and thus improve data association and false alarm rejection. Our NEBP method improves tracking performance compared to model-based methods. At the same time, it inherits the advantages of BP-based MOT, i.e., it scales only quadratically in the number of objects, and it can thus generate and maintain a large number of object tracks. We evaluate the performance of our NEBP approach for MOT on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08340v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Measurement of collisions between rubidium atoms and optically dark
  rubidium ions"	Seunghyun Lee	K. Ravi, S. A. Rangwala	2013-04-09 08:46:20	We measure the collision rate coefficient between laser cooled Rubidium (Rb) atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and optically dark Rb+ ions in an overlapping Paul trap. In such a mixture, the ions are created from the MOT atoms and allowed to accumulate in the ion trap, which results in a significant reduction in the number of steady state MOT atoms. A theoretical rate equation model is developed to describe the evolution of the MOT atom number, due to ionization and ion-atom collision, and derive an expression for the ion-atom collision rate coefficient. The loss of MOT atoms is studied systematically, by sequentially switching on the various mechanisms in the experiment. Combining the measurements with the model allows the direct determination of the ion-atom collision rate coefficient. Finally the scope of the experimental technique developed here is discussed.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.87.052701	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Design of Magneto-Optical Traps for Additive Manufacture by 3D Printing	Yijia Zhou	Nathan Welch, Rosemary Crawford, Fedja Oručević, Feiran Wang, Peter Krüger, Ricky Wildman, Christopher Tuck, T. Mark Fromhold	2017-04-03 05:42:12	A key element in the study of cold atoms, and their use in emerging quantum technologies, is trapping the atoms in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber. Many methods have been used to trap atoms including atom chips and magneto-optical traps (MOTs). However, the bulky apparatus, and current-carrying coils, used so far in most MOTs restrict the reduction of power and physical size, as required for quantum technology applications. The advent of 3D printing technology now offers a new route to making MOTs with current paths that can be freely shaped and shrunk to several centimetres, thereby helping to reduce the power consumption and simplify the production of the MOT itself. In this paper, we present designs for 3D printed MOTs and analyse their performance by using COMSOL simulations. We predict that the 3D-printed conductors can create magnetic fields with gradients around 15 G/cm and passing through zero, as required for atom trapping, with Joule heating as low as 0.2 W.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00430v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A steady-state magneto-optical trap with 100 fold improved phase-space
  density"	Shayne Bennetts	Chun-Chia Chen, Benjamin Pasquiou, Florian Schreck	2017-07-17 19:09:13	We demonstrate a continuously loaded $^{88}\mathrm{Sr}$ magneto-optical trap (MOT) with a steady-state phase-space density of $1.3(2) \times 10^{-3}$. This is two orders of magnitude higher than reported in previous steady-state MOTs. Our approach is to flow atoms through a series of spatially separated laser cooling stages before capturing them in a MOT operated on the 7.4-kHz linewidth Sr intercombination line using a hybrid slower+MOT configuration. We also demonstrate producing a Bose-Einstein condensate at the MOT location, despite the presence of laser cooling light on resonance with the 30-MHz linewidth transition used to initially slow atoms in a separate chamber. Our steady-state high phase-space density MOT is an excellent starting point for a continuous atom laser and dead-time free atom interferometers or clocks.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.223202	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Quasi-Round MOTSs and Stability of the Schwarzschild Null Penrose
  Inequality"	Henri Roesch	Aucun	2018-06-25 19:25:45	In recent work, the notion of Double Convexity for a foliation of a conical null hypersurface was introduced to give a proof, if satisfied, of the Null Penrose Inequality. Double Convexity constrains the geometry of a Marginally Outer Trapped Surface (MOTS), called a quasi-round MOTS. In the first part of this paper, for a class of strictly stable Weakly Isolated Horizons, we show the existence of a unique foliation by quasi-round MOTS. In the second part, we show that any subsequent space-time perturbation continues to admit a quasi-round MOTS. Finally, for perturbations of the quasi-round MOTS in Schwarzschild, we identify sufficient conditions on the asymptotics of any past-pointing null hypersurface that yields the Null Penrose Inequality.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09675v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Learning Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation from Automatic
  Annotations"	Lorenzo Porzi	Markus Hofinger, Idoia Ruiz, Joan Serrat, Samuel Rota Bulò, Peter Kontschieder	2019-12-04 16:38:24	In this work we contribute a novel pipeline to automatically generate training data, and to improve over state-of-the-art multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS) methods. Our proposed track mining algorithm turns raw street-level videos into high-fidelity MOTS training data, is scalable and overcomes the need of expensive and time-consuming manual annotation approaches. We leverage state-of-the-art instance segmentation results in combination with optical flow predictions, also trained on automatically harvested training data. Our second major contribution is MOTSNet - a deep learning, tracking-by-detection architecture for MOTS - deploying a novel mask-pooling layer for improved object association over time. Training MOTSNet with our automatically extracted data leads to significantly improved sMOTSA scores on the novel KITTI MOTS dataset (+1.9%/+7.5% on cars/pedestrians), and MOTSNet improves by +4.1% over previously best methods on the MOTSChallenge dataset. Our most impressive finding is that we can improve over previous best-performing works, even in complete absence of manually annotated MOTS training data.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02096v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
PointTrack++ for Effective Online Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation	Zhenbo Xu	Wei Zhang, Xiao Tan, Wei Yang, Xiangbo Su, Yuchen Yuan, Hongwu Zhang, Shilei Wen, Errui Ding, Liusheng Huang	2020-07-03 08:28:37	Multiple-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS) is a novel computer vision task that aims to jointly perform multiple object tracking (MOT) and instance segmentation. In this work, we present PointTrack++, an effective on-line framework for MOTS, which remarkably extends our recently proposed PointTrack framework. To begin with, PointTrack adopts an efficient one-stage framework for instance segmentation, and learns instance embeddings by converting compact image representations to un-ordered 2D point cloud. Compared with PointTrack, our proposed PointTrack++ offers three major improvements. Firstly, in the instance segmentation stage, we adopt a semantic segmentation decoder trained with focal loss to improve the instance selection quality. Secondly, to further boost the segmentation performance, we propose a data augmentation strategy by copy-and-paste instances into training images. Finally, we introduce a better training strategy in the instance association stage to improve the distinguishability of learned instance embeddings. The resulting framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the 5th BMTT MOTChallenge.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01549v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
ReMOTS: Self-Supervised Refining Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation	Fan Yang	Xin Chang, Chenyu Dang, Ziqiang Zheng, Sakriani Sakti, Satoshi Nakamura, Yang Wu	2020-07-07 04:49:10	We aim to improve the performance of Multiple Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) by refinement. However, it remains challenging for refining MOTS results, which could be attributed to that appearance features are not adapted to target videos and it is also difficult to find proper thresholds to discriminate them. To tackle this issue, we propose a self-supervised refining MOTS (i.e., ReMOTS) framework. ReMOTS mainly takes four steps to refine MOTS results from the data association perspective. (1) Training the appearance encoder using predicted masks. (2) Associating observations across adjacent frames to form short-term tracklets. (3) Training the appearance encoder using short-term tracklets as reliable pseudo labels. (4) Merging short-term tracklets to long-term tracklets utilizing adopted appearance features and thresholds that are automatically obtained from statistical information. Using ReMOTS, we reached the $1^{st}$ place on CVPR 2020 MOTS Challenge 1, with an sMOTSA score of $69.9$.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03200v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Single atom counting in a two-color magneto-optical trap	Martin Schlederer	Alexandra Mozdzen, Thomas Lompe, Henning Moritz	2020-11-19 19:39:55	Recording the fluorescence of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) is a standard tool for measuring atom numbers in experiments with ultracold atoms. When trapping few atoms in a small MOT, the emitted fluorescence increases with the atom number in discrete steps, which allows to measure the atom number with single-particle resolution. Achieving such single particle resolution requires stringent minimization of stray light from the MOT beams, which is very difficult to achieve in experimental setups that require in-vacuum components close to the atoms. Here, we present a modified scheme that addresses this issue: Instead of collecting the fluorescence on the MOT (D2) transition, we scatter light on an additional probing (D1) transition and collect this fluorescence with a high-resolution microscope while filtering out the intense MOT light. Using this scheme, we are able to reliably distinguish up to 17 $^{40}$K atoms with an average classification fidelity of 95 \%.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.103.033308	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A two-stage data association approach for 3D Multi-object Tracking	Minh-Quan Dao	Vincent Frémont	2021-01-21 15:50:17	Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an integral part of any autonomous driving pipelines because itproduces trajectories which has been taken by other moving objects in the scene and helps predicttheir future motion. Thanks to the recent advances in 3D object detection enabled by deep learning,track-by-detection has become the dominant paradigm in 3D MOT. In this paradigm, a MOT systemis essentially made of an object detector and a data association algorithm which establishes track-to-detection correspondence. While 3D object detection has been actively researched, associationalgorithms for 3D MOT seem to settle at a bipartie matching formulated as a linear assignmentproblem (LAP) and solved by the Hungarian algorithm. In this paper, we adapt a two-stage dataassociation method which was successful in image-based tracking to the 3D setting, thus providingan alternative for data association for 3D MOT. Our method outperforms the baseline using one-stagebipartie matching for data association by achieving 0.587 AMOTA in NuScenes validation set.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08684v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Multi-Object Tracking using Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Mixture Filtering
  for Autonomous Vehicles"	Su Pang	Hayder Radha	2021-03-13 20:24:18	The ability of an autonomous vehicle to perform 3D tracking is essential for safe planing and navigation in cluttered environments. The main challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT) in autonomous driving applications reside in the inherent uncertainties regarding the number of objects, when and where the objects may appear and disappear, and uncertainties regarding objects' states. Random finite set (RFS) based approaches can naturally model these uncertainties accurately and elegantly, and they have been widely used in radar-based tracking applications. In this work, we developed an RFS-based MOT framework for 3D LiDAR data. In partiuclar, we propose a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter to solve the amodal MOT problem for autonomous driving applications. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first attempt for employing an RFS-based approach in conjunction with 3D LiDAR data for MOT applications with comprehensive validation using challenging datasets made available by industry leaders. The superior experimental results of our PMBM tracker on public Waymo and Argoverse datasets clearly illustrate that an RFS-based tracker outperforms many state-of-the-art deep learning-based and Kalman filter-based methods, and consequently, these results indicate a great potential for further exploration of RFS-based frameworks for 3D MOT applications.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07783v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Efficient loading of thulium atoms in a compact MOT for a transportable
  optical clock"	A. Golovizin	D. Tregubov, D. Mishin, D. Provorchenko, N. Kolachevsky	2021-05-05 15:53:46	We report on building of a compact vacuum chamber for spectroscopy of ultracold thulium and trapping of up to 13 million atoms. Compactness is achieved by obviating a classical Zeeman slower section and placing an atomic oven close to a magneto-optical trap (MOT), specifically at the distance of 11 cm. In this configuration, we significantly gained in solid angle of an atomic beam, which is affected by MOT laser beams, and reached 1 million atoms loaded directly in the MOT. By exploiting Zeeman-like deceleration of atoms with an additional laser beam, we increased the number of trapped atoms to 6 million. Then we gained an extra factor of 2 by tailoring the MOT magnetic field gradient with an additional small magnetic coil. Demonstrated results show great perspective of the developed setup for realizing a compact high-performance optical atomic clock based on thulium atoms.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02145v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
An Uncertainty-Aware Performance Measure for Multi-Object Tracking	Juliano Pinto	Yuxuan Xia, Lennart Svensson, Henk Wymeersch	2021-08-10 12:01:12	Evaluating the performance of multi-object tracking (MOT) methods is not straightforward, and existing performance measures fail to consider all the available uncertainty information in the MOT context. This can lead practitioners to select models which produce uncertainty estimates of lower quality, negatively impacting any downstream systems that rely on them. Additionally, most MOT performance measures have hyperparameters, which makes comparisons of different trackers less straightforward. We propose the use of the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of the multi-object posterior given the set of ground-truth objects as a performance measure. This measure takes into account all available uncertainty information in a sound mathematical manner without hyperparameters. We provide efficient algorithms for approximating the computation of the NLL for several common MOT algorithms, show that in some cases it decomposes and approximates the widely-used GOSPA metric, and provide several illustrative examples highlighting the advantages of the NLL in comparison to other MOT performance measures.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3103488	cs	arxiv					0.0

  open transition at 420 nm"	Rajnandan Choudhury Das	Dangka Shylla, Arkapravo Bera, Kanhaiya Pandey	2022-05-09 05:48:49	Magneto-optical trap (MOT) at narrow (weak) transition offers lower temperature and hence is the key for production of high phase density atomic cloud and subsequently quantum degeneracy with high number of atoms for many elements. In this paper, we describe loading of $^{87}$Rb atoms in the MOT using a narrow open transition at 420 nm from the routinely implemented MOT using broad cyclic transition at 780 nm (IR). The total linewidth of the blue transition, 5S$_{1/2} \rightarrow $ 6P$_{3/2}$ is 1.4 MHz, which is around 4 times narrower than the standard 5S$_{1/2} \rightarrow$ 5P$_{3/2}$ cyclic transition. Using this narrow transition, we have trapped around $10^{8}$ atoms in the MOT with a typical temperature of around $54~\mu$K. We have also studied the behavior of the blue MOT with various parameters such as hold time, detuning and power of trapping and repumper beams.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04054v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Depth Perspective-aware Multiple Object Tracking	Kha Gia Quach	Huu Le, Pha Nguyen, Chi Nhan Duong, Tien Dai Bui, Khoa Luu	2022-07-10 22:12:00	This paper aims to tackle Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), an important problem in computer vision but remains challenging due to many practical issues, especially occlusions. Indeed, we propose a new real-time Depth Perspective-aware Multiple Object Tracking (DP-MOT) approach to tackle the occlusion problem in MOT. A simple yet efficient Subject-Ordered Depth Estimation (SODE) is first proposed to automatically order the depth positions of detected subjects in a 2D scene in an unsupervised manner. Using the output from SODE, a new Active pseudo-3D Kalman filter, a simple but effective extension of Kalman filter with dynamic control variables, is then proposed to dynamically update the movement of objects. In addition, a new high-order association approach is presented in the data association step to incorporate first-order and second-order relationships between the detected objects. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to recent MOT methods on standard MOT benchmarks.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04551v2	cs	arxiv					0.0

  Motion-Aware Features"	Zhong-Min Tsai	Yu-Ju Tsai, Chien-Yao Wang, Hong-Yuan Liao, Youn-Long Lin, Yung-Yu Chuang	2022-10-29 11:17:53	The paper presents a new method, SearchTrack, for multiple object tracking and segmentation (MOTS). To address the association problem between detected objects, SearchTrack proposes object-customized search and motion-aware features. By maintaining a Kalman filter for each object, we encode the predicted motion into the motion-aware feature, which includes both motion and appearance cues. For each object, a customized fully convolutional search engine is created by SearchTrack by learning a set of weights for dynamic convolutions specific to the object. Experiments demonstrate that our SearchTrack method outperforms competitive methods on both MOTS and MOT tasks, particularly in terms of association accuracy. Our method achieves 71.5 HOTA (car) and 57.6 HOTA (pedestrian) on the KITTI MOTS and 53.4 HOTA on MOT17. In terms of association accuracy, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among 2D online methods on the KITTI MOTS. Our code is available at https://github.com/qa276390/SearchTrack.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16572v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Blue-Detuned Magneto-Optical Trap of Molecules	Justin J. Burau	Parul Aggarwal, Kameron Mehling, Jun Ye	2022-12-14 19:34:52	Direct laser cooling of molecules has reached a phase space density exceeding 10$^{-6}$ in optical traps, but with rather small molecular numbers. To progress towards quantum degeneracy, a mechanism is needed that combines sub-Doppler cooling and magneto-optical trapping (MOT) to facilitate near unity transfer of ultracold molecules from the MOT to a conservative optical trap. Using the unique energy level structure of YO molecules, we demonstrate the first blue-detuned MOT for molecules that is optimized for both gray-molasses sub-Doppler cooling and relatively strong trapping forces. This first sub-Doppler molecular MOT provides an increase of phase-space density by two orders of magnitude over any previously reported molecular MOT.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.193401	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Simulations of a frequency-chirped magneto-optical trap of MgF	Kayla J. Rodriguez	Nickolas H. Pilgram, Daniel S. Barker, Stephen P. Eckel, Eric B. Norrgard	2023-05-08 17:25:59	We simulate the capture process of MgF molecules into a frequency-chirped molecular MOT. Our calculations show that by chirping the frequency, the MOT capture velocity is increased by about of factor of 4 to 80 m/s, allowing for direct loading from a two-stage cryogenic buffer gas beam source. Moreover, we simulate the effect of this frequency chirp for molecules already present in the MOT. We find that the MOT should be stable with little to no molecule loss. The chirped MOT should thus allow loading of multiple molecule pulses to increase the number of trapped molecules	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.033105	cs	arxiv					0.0	
MoT: Memory-of-Thought Enables ChatGPT to Self-Improve	Xiaonan Li	Xipeng Qiu	2023-05-09 05:25:05	Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in various tasks. However, fundamentally improving them depends on high-quality datasets or computationally expensive fine-tuning. On the contrary, humans can easily improve themselves by self-thinking and memory, without external resources. In this paper, we propose a framework, MoT, to let the LLM self-improve through Memory-of-Thought, without annotated datasets and parameter updates. Specifically, MoT is divided into two stages: 1. before the test stage, the LLM pre-thinks on the unlabeled dataset and saves the high-confidence thoughts as external memory; 2. During the test stage, given a test question, the LLM recalls relevant memory to help itself reason and answer it. Experimental results show that MoT can help ChatGPT significantly improve its abilities in arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, factual reasoning, and natural language inference. Further analyses show that each component contributes critically to the improvements and MoT can lead to consistent improvements across various CoT methods and LLMs.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05181v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Blue-detuned molecular magneto-optical trap schemes based on bayesian
  optimization"	S. Xu	R. Li, Y. Zhai, Y. Xia, M. Siercke, S. Ospelkaus	2023-05-26 01:55:03	Direct laser cooling and trapping of molecules to temperature below Doppler limit and density exceeding $10^8$ are challenging due to the sub-Doppler heating effects of molecular magneto-optical trap (MOT). In our previous paper [1], we presented a general approach to engineering the sub- Doppler force by tuning the AC stark shift with the addition of a blue detuned laser. Here, by employing the Bayesian optimization method to optical Bloch equations, we have identified multiple blue-detuned MOT schemes for the CaF molecule. From the three-dimensional Monte-Carlo simulation, we obtained a MOT temperature and density of 14 $\rm \mu K$ and $\rm 4.5 \times 10^8 cm^{-3}$, respectively. Our findings present a potential avenue for directly loading molecular MOTs into conservative traps, which can capitalize on the high density and low temperature of the MOT	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16576v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

  molecules"	J. Kleinert	C. Haimberger, P. J. Zabawa, N. P. Bigelow	2007-07-16 16:52:12	We present a detailed description on how to build a Thin WIre electroStatic Trap (TWIST) for ultracold polar molecules. It is the first design of an electrostatic trap that can be superimposed directly onto a magneto optical trap (MOT). We can thus continuously produce ultracold polar molecules via photoassociation from a two species MOT and instantaneously trap them in the TWIST without the need for complex transfer schemes. Despite the spatial overlap of the TWIST and the MOT, the two traps can be operated and optimized completely independently due to the complementary nature of the utilized trapping mechanisms.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2815338	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Blowup of Jang's equation at outermost marginally trapped surfaces	Jan Metzger	Aucun	2007-11-29 15:45:01	The aim of this paper is to collect some facts about the blowup of Jang's equation. First, we discuss how to construct solutions that blow up at an outermost MOTS. Second, we exclude the possibility that there are extra blowup surfaces in data sets with non-positive mean curvature. Then we investigate the rate of convergence of the blowup to a cylinder near a strictly stable MOTS and show exponential convergence near a strictly stable MOTS.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00220-009-0934-x	cs	arxiv					0.0

We begin with a systematic review of results by Schoen and Yau on Jang's equation and its relationship with MOTS. We then explain recent work on the existence, regularity, and properties of MOTS and discuss the consequences for the trapped region. We include an outlook with some directions for future research.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4601v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Stability of MOTS in totally geodesic null horizons	Marc Mars	Aucun	2012-05-08 15:15:57	Closed sections of totally geodesic null hypersurfaces are marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS), for which a well-defined notion of stability exists. In this paper we obtain the explicit form for the stability operator for such MOTS and analyze in detail its properties in the particular case of non-evolving horizons, which include both isolated and Killing horizons. We link these stability properties with the surface gravity of the horizon and/or to the existence of minimal sections. The results are used, in particular, to obtain an area-angular momentum inequality for sections of axially symmetric horizons in four spacetime dimensions, which helps clarifying the relationship between two different approaches to this inequality existing in the literature.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/29/14/145019	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Black hole horizons and quantum charged particles	José Luis Jaramillo	Aucun	2014-10-02 10:56:55	We point out a structural similarity between the characterization of black hole apparent horizons as stable marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS) and the quantum description of a non-relativistic charged particle moving in given magnetic and electric fields on a closed surface. Specifically, the spectral problem of the MOTS-stability operator corresponds to a stationary quantum particle with a formal fine-structure constant $\alpha$ of negative sign. We discuss how such analogy enriches both problems, illustrating this with the insights into the MOTS-spectral problem gained from the analysis of the spectrum of the quantum charged particle Hamiltonian.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/32/13/132001	cs	arxiv					0.0

Hudson, Svetlana Kotochigova	2019-01-25 19:45:22	An important physical process unique to neutral-ion systems is the charge-transfer (CT) reaction. Here, we present measurements of and models for CT processes between co-trapped ultracold Ca atoms and Yb ions under well-controlled conditions. The theoretical analysis reveals the existence of three reaction mechanisms when lasers from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and an additional catalyst laser are present. Besides the direct CT involving existent excited Ca population in the MOT, the second pathway is controlled by MOT-induced CT, whereas the third one mostly involves the additional red-detuned laser.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.062706	cs	arxiv					0.0

The machine includes a science vacuum chamber and the relevant laser systems for cooling and trapping the atoms. With this machine, we realize a D2-line compressed magneto-optical trap (MOT) for ${^6}$Li and a narrow-linewidth 689-nm MOT for $^{84}$Sr, obtaining ~$10^9$ ${^6}$Li atoms at 700 $\mu$K and ~$10^7$ $^{84}$Sr atoms at 1.8 $\mu$K. Such a dual-species MOT provides an ideal starting point for realizing double degenerate mixtures of $^6$Li and Sr atoms.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05230v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

These objects are associated across frames using spatial, colour and class label information, and trajectory prediction is evaluated to yield the final MOT outputs. The proposed method was tested on the Urban tracker dataset and shows competitive performances compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Results show that the integration of different detection inputs remains a challenging task that greatly affects the MOT performance.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06381v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Ospelkaus	2022-03-15 10:02:12	Current dual-frequency magneto-optical traps for ultracold molecules are plagued by sub-Doppler heating effects, making them vastly inferior to standard atomic MOTs. Here we demonstrate theoretically that the sub-Doppler effects in such a MOT can be engineered to provide cooling instead of heating. We give an intuitive picture how to achieve such cooling and show the cooling and trapping force results of the 16 level optical Bloch equations for the case of CaF molecules. From three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations we estimate the temperature and density of our MOT to be $40 \mu K$ and $4 \times 10^8 cm^{-3}$ respectively for a molecule number of $10^5$.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.L042036	cs	arxiv					0.0

Magneto-optical trap performance for high-bandwidth applications	Benjamin Adams	Sachin Kinge, Kai Bongs, Yu-Hung Lien	2023-09-25 10:43:26	We study the dynamics of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating at high-bandwidth. We find the absolute importance of high recapture efficiency between cycles to maintain a practical atom number. We develop a simple model accounting for MOT trapping forces and pressure induced collisions and validate with experimental data using $\mathrm{{}^{87}Rb}$. This is then applied to quantum sensing predicting a shot noise limited sensitivity of $\mathrm{10^{-7}g/\sqrt{Hz}}$ for a gravimeter at 100 Hz operation. The results are useful for understanding MOT operation at high-bandwidth, particularly in the context of developing mobile high-bandwidth quantum inertial sensors targeting dynamic environments and navigation applications.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14026v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Deep MDP: A Modular Framework for Multi-Object Tracking	Abhineet Singh	Aucun	2023-10-22 13:17:37	This paper presents a fast and modular framework for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) based on the Markov descision process (MDP) tracking-by-detection paradigm. It is designed to allow its various functional components to be replaced by custom-designed alternatives to suit a given application. An interactive GUI with integrated object detection, segmentation, MOT and semi-automated labeling is also provided to help make it easier to get started with this framework. Though not breaking new ground in terms of performance, Deep MDP has a large code-base that should be useful for the community to try out new ideas or simply to have an easy-to-use and easy-to-adapt system for any MOT application.

Symmetry and instability of marginally outer trapped surfaces	Ivan Booth	Graham Cox, Juan Margalef-Bentabol	2023-11-03 17:47:23	We consider an initial data set having a continuous symmetry and a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS) that is not preserved by this symmetry. We show that such a MOTS is unstable except in an exceptional case. In non-rotating cases we provide a Courant-type lower bound on the number of unstable eigenvalues. These results are then used to prove the instability of a large class of exotic MOTS that were recently observed in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We also discuss the implications for the apparent horizon in data sets with translational symmetry.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02063v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Low-temperature, high-density magneto-optical trapping of potassium
  using the open 4S-5P transition at 405 nm"	D. C. McKay	D. Jervis, D. J. Fine, J. W. Simpson-Porco, G. J. A. Edge, J. H. Thywissen	2011-10-18 17:40:08	We report the laser cooling and trapping of neutral potassium on an open transition. Fermionic 40K is captured using a magneto-optical trap (MOT) on the closed 4S-4P transition at 767 nm and then transferred, with unit efficiency, to a MOT on the open 4S-5P transition at 405 nm. Because the 5P state has a smaller line width than the 4P state, the Doppler limit is reduced. We observe temperatures as low as 63(6) microkelvin, the coldest potassium MOT reported to date. The density of trapped atoms also increases, due to reduced temperature and reduced expulsive light forces. We measure a two-body loss coefficient of 2 x 10^-10 cm^3/s, and estimate an upper bound of 8x10^-18 cm^2 for the ionization cross section of the 5P state at 405 nm. The combined temperature and density improvement in the 405 nm MOT is a twenty-fold increase in phase space density over our 767 nm MOT, showing enhanced pre-cooling for quantum gas experiments. A qualitatively similar enhancement is observed in a 405 nm MOT of bosonic 41K.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.84.063420	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Joint Object Detection and Multi-Object Tracking with Graph Neural
  Networks"	Yongxin Wang	Kris Kitani, Xinshuo Weng	2020-06-23 17:07:00	Object detection and data association are critical components in multi-object tracking (MOT) systems. Despite the fact that the two components are dependent on each other, prior works often design detection and data association modules separately which are trained with separate objectives. As a result, one cannot back-propagate the gradients and optimize the entire MOT system, which leads to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, recent works simultaneously optimize detection and data association modules under a joint MOT framework, which has shown improved performance in both modules. In this work, we propose a new instance of joint MOT approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The key idea is that GNNs can model relations between variable-sized objects in both the spatial and temporal domains, which is essential for learning discriminative features for detection and data association. Through extensive experiments on the MOT15/16/17/20 datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our GNN-based joint MOT approach and show state-of-the-art performance for both detection and MOT tasks.

"Segment as Points for Efficient Online Multi-Object Tracking and
  Segmentation"	Zhenbo Xu	Wei Zhang, Xiao Tan, Wei Yang, Huan Huang, Shilei Wen, Errui Ding, Liusheng Huang	2020-07-03 08:29:35	Current multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS) methods follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm and adopt convolutions for feature extraction. However, as affected by the inherent receptive field, convolution based feature extraction inevitably mixes up the foreground features and the background features, resulting in ambiguities in the subsequent instance association. In this paper, we propose a highly effective method for learning instance embeddings based on segments by converting the compact image representation to un-ordered 2D point cloud representation. Our method generates a new tracking-by-points paradigm where discriminative instance embeddings are learned from randomly selected points rather than images. Furthermore, multiple informative data modalities are converted into point-wise representations to enrich point-wise features. The resulting online MOTS framework, named PointTrack, surpasses all the state-of-the-art methods including 3D tracking methods by large margins (5.4% higher MOTSA and 18 times faster over MOTSFusion) with the near real-time speed (22 FPS). Evaluations across three datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Moreover, based on the observation that current MOTS datasets lack crowded scenes, we build a more challenging MOTS dataset named APOLLO MOTS with higher instance density. Both APOLLO MOTS and our codes are publicly available at https://github.com/detectRecog/PointTrack.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01550v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Simultaneous Detection and Tracking with Motion Modelling for Multiple
  Object Tracking"	ShiJie Sun	Naveed Akhtar, XiangYu Song, HuanSheng Song, Ajmal Mian, Mubarak Shah	2020-08-20 08:05:33	Deep learning-based Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) currently relies on off-the-shelf detectors for tracking-by-detection.This results in deep models that are detector biased and evaluations that are detector influenced. To resolve this issue, we introduce Deep Motion Modeling Network (DMM-Net) that can estimate multiple objects' motion parameters to perform joint detection and association in an end-to-end manner. DMM-Net models object features over multiple frames and simultaneously infers object classes, visibility, and their motion parameters. These outputs are readily used to update the tracklets for efficient MOT. DMM-Net achieves PR-MOTA score of 12.80 @ 120+ fps for the popular UA-DETRAC challenge, which is better performance and orders of magnitude faster. We also contribute a synthetic large-scale public dataset Omni-MOT for vehicle tracking that provides precise ground-truth annotations to eliminate the detector influence in MOT evaluation. This 14M+ frames dataset is extendable with our public script (Code at Dataset <https://github.com/shijieS/OmniMOTDataset>, Dataset Recorder <https://github.com/shijieS/OMOTDRecorder>, Omni-MOT Source <https://github.com/shijieS/DMMN>). We demonstrate the suitability of Omni-MOT for deep learning with DMMNet and also make the source code of our network public.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08826v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Grating magneto-optical traps with complicated level structures	D. S. Barker	P. K. Elgee, A. Sitaram, E. B. Norrgard, N. N. Klimov, G. K. Campbell, S. Eckel	2023-05-12 19:07:07	We study the forces and optical pumping within grating magneto-optical traps (MOTs) operating on transitions with non-trivial level structure. In contrast to the standard six-beam MOT configuration, rate equation modelling predicts that the asymmetric laser geometry of a grating MOT will produce spin-polarized atomic samples. Furthermore, the Land\'e $g$-factors and total angular momenta of the trapping transition strongly influence both the confinement and equilibrium position of the trap. Using the intuition gained from the rate equation model, we realize a grating MOT of fermionic $^{87}$Sr and observe that it forms closer to the center of the trap's quadrupole magnetic field than its bosonic counterpart. We also explore the application of grating MOTs to molecule laser cooling, where the rate equations suggest that dual-frequency operation is necessary, but not sufficient, for stable confinement for type-II level structures. To test our molecule laser cooling models, we create grating MOTs using the $D_1$ line of $^7$Li and see that only two of the four possible six-beam polarization configurations operate in the grating geometry. Our results will aid the development of portable atom and molecule traps for time keeping, inertial navigation, and precision measurement.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07732v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Bridging the Gap Between End-to-end and Non-End-to-end Multi-Object
  Tracking"	Feng Yan	Weixin Luo, Yujie Zhong, Yiyang Gan, Lin Ma	2023-05-22 05:18:34	Existing end-to-end Multi-Object Tracking (e2e-MOT) methods have not surpassed non-end-to-end tracking-by-detection methods. One potential reason is its label assignment strategy during training that consistently binds the tracked objects with tracking queries and then assigns the few newborns to detection queries. With one-to-one bipartite matching, such an assignment will yield unbalanced training, i.e., scarce positive samples for detection queries, especially for an enclosed scene, as the majority of the newborns come on stage at the beginning of videos. Thus, e2e-MOT will be easier to yield a tracking terminal without renewal or re-initialization, compared to other tracking-by-detection methods. To alleviate this problem, we present Co-MOT, a simple and effective method to facilitate e2e-MOT by a novel coopetition label assignment with a shadow concept. Specifically, we add tracked objects to the matching targets for detection queries when performing the label assignment for training the intermediate decoders. For query initialization, we expand each query by a set of shadow counterparts with limited disturbance to itself. With extensive ablations, Co-MOT achieves superior performance without extra costs, e.g., 69.4% HOTA on DanceTrack and 52.8% TETA on BDD100K. Impressively, Co-MOT only requires 38\% FLOPs of MOTRv2 to attain a similar performance, resulting in the 1.4$\times$ faster inference speed.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12724v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Poly-MOT: A Polyhedral Framework For 3D Multi-Object Tracking	Xiaoyu Li	Tao Xie, Dedong Liu, Jinghan Gao, Kun Dai, Zhiqiang Jiang, Lijun Zhao, Ke Wang	2023-07-31 13:51:24	3D Multi-object tracking (MOT) empowers mobile robots to accomplish well-informed motion planning and navigation tasks by providing motion trajectories of surrounding objects. However, existing 3D MOT methods typically employ a single similarity metric and physical model to perform data association and state estimation for all objects. With large-scale modern datasets and real scenes, there are a variety of object categories that commonly exhibit distinctive geometric properties and motion patterns. In this way, such distinctions would enable various object categories to behave differently under the same standard, resulting in erroneous matches between trajectories and detections, and jeopardizing the reliability of downstream tasks (navigation, etc.). Towards this end, we propose Poly-MOT, an efficient 3D MOT method based on the Tracking-By-Detection framework that enables the tracker to choose the most appropriate tracking criteria for each object category. Specifically, Poly-MOT leverages different motion models for various object categories to characterize distinct types of motion accurately. We also introduce the constraint of the rigid structure of objects into a specific motion model to accurately describe the highly nonlinear motion of the object. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage data association strategy to ensure that objects can find the optimal similarity metric from three custom metrics for their categories and reduce missing matches. On the NuScenes dataset, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 75.4\% AMOTA.

3D Multiple Object Tracking on Autonomous Driving: A Literature Review	Peng Zhang	Xin Li, Liang He, Xin Lin	2023-09-27 05:32:26	3D multi-object tracking (3D MOT) stands as a pivotal domain within autonomous driving, experiencing a surge in scholarly interest and commercial promise over recent years. Despite its paramount significance, 3D MOT confronts a myriad of formidable challenges, encompassing abrupt alterations in object appearances, pervasive occlusion, the presence of diminutive targets, data sparsity, missed detections, and the unpredictable initiation and termination of object motion trajectories. Countless methodologies have emerged to grapple with these issues, yet 3D MOT endures as a formidable problem that warrants further exploration. This paper undertakes a comprehensive examination, assessment, and synthesis of the research landscape in this domain, remaining attuned to the latest developments in 3D MOT while suggesting prospective avenues for future investigation. Our exploration commences with a systematic exposition of key facets of 3D MOT and its associated domains, including problem delineation, classification, methodological approaches, fundamental principles, and empirical investigations. Subsequently, we categorize these methodologies into distinct groups, dissecting each group meticulously with regard to its challenges, underlying rationale, progress, merits, and demerits. Furthermore, we present a concise recapitulation of experimental metrics and offer an overview of prevalent datasets, facilitating a quantitative comparison for a more intuitive assessment. Lastly, our deliberations culminate in a discussion of the prevailing research landscape, highlighting extant challenges and charting possible directions for 3D MOT research. We present a structured and lucid road-map to guide forthcoming endeavors in this field.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15411v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Two-species magneto-optical trap with 40K and 87Rb	J. Goldwin	S. B. Papp, B. DeMarco, D. S.

This trap represents the first step towards cooling the Bose-Fermi mixture to quantum degeneracy. Laser light for the MOT is derived from laser diodes and amplified with a single high power semiconductor amplifier chip.

Intense slow beams of bosonic potassium isotopes	J. Catani	P. Maioli, L. De Sarlo, F. Minardi, M.

The high measured fluxes up to 1.0x10^11 atoms/s and low atomic velocities around 33 m/s are well suited for a fast and reliable 3D-MOT loading, a basilar feature for new generation experiments on Bose-Einstein condensation of dilute atomic samples. We also present a simple multilevel theoretical model for the calculation of the light-induced force acting on an atom moving in a MOT.

An Intense Source of Cold Rb Atoms from a Pure 2D-MOT	J. Schoser	A. Bataer, R. Loew, V. Schweikhard, A. Grabowski, Yu. B. Ovchinnikov, T. Pfau	2002-01-16 19:48:55	We present a 2D-MOT setup for the production of a continuous collimated beam of cold 87-Rb atoms out of a vapor cell. The underlying physics is purely two-dimensional cooling and trapping, which allows for a high flux of up to 6*10^(10) atoms/s and a small divergence of the resulting beam. We analyze the velocity distribution of the 2D-MOT. The longitudinal velocity distribution of the atomic beam shows a broad feature(FWHM=75m/s), centered around 50m/s. The dependence of the flux on laser intensity, geometry of the trapping volume and on pressure in the vapor cell was investigated in detail. The influence of the geometry of the 2D-MOT on the mean velocity of the cold beam has been studied. We present a simple model for the velocity distribution of the flux based on rate equations describing the general dependencies.	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0201034v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Magneto-optical trap for metastable helium at 389 nm	J. C. J. Koelemeij	R. J. W. Stas, W. Hogervorst, W. Vassen	2002-10-15 11:35:28	We have constructed a magneto-optical trap (MOT) for metastable triplet helium atoms utilizing the 2 3S1 -> 3 3P2 line at 389 nm as the trapping and cooling transition. The far-red-detuned MOT (detuning Delta = -41 MHz) typically contains few times 10^7 atoms at a relatively high (~10^9 cm^-3) density, which is a consequence of the large momentum transfer per photon at 389 nm and a small two-body loss rate coefficient (2 * 10^-10 cm^3/s < beta < 1.0 * 10^-9 cm^3/s). The two-body loss rate is more than five times smaller than in a MOT on the commonly used 2 3S1 -> 2 3P2 line at 1083 nm. Furthermore, we measure a temperature of 0.46(1) mK, a factor 2.5 lower as compared to the 1083 nm case. Decreasing the detuning to Delta= -9 MHz results in a cloud temperature as low as 0.25(1) mK, at small number of trapped atoms. The 389 nm MOT exhibits small losses due to two-photon ionization, which have been investigated as well.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.67.053406	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Magnetic Trapping of Metastable Calcium Atoms	Dirk P. Hansen	Janis R. Mohr, Andreas Hemmerich	2002-10-29 13:10:07	Metastable calcium atoms, produced in a magneto-optic trap (MOT) operating within the singlet system, are continuously loaded into a magnetic trap formed by the magnetic quadrupole field of the MOT. At MOT temperatures of 3 mK and 240 ms loading time we observe 1.1 x 10^8 magnetically trapped 3P2 atoms at densities of 2.4 x 10^8 cm^-3 and temperatures of 0.61 mK. In a modified scheme we first load a MOT for metastable atoms at a temperature of 0.18 mK and subsequently release these atoms into the magnetic trap. In this case 240 ms of loading yields 2.4 x 10^8 trapped 3P2 atoms at a peak density of 8.7 x 10^10 cm^-3 and a temperature of 0.13 mK. The temperature decrease observed in the magnetic trap for both loading schemes can be explained only in part by trap size effects.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.67.021401	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Stability of marginally outer trapped surfaces and existence of
  marginally outer trapped tubes"	Lars Andersson	Marc Mars, Walter Simon	2007-04-22 15:13:38	The present work extends our short communication Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 111102 (2005). For smooth marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS) in a smooth spacetime we define stability with respect to variations along arbitrary vectors v normal to the MOTS. After giving some introductory material about linear non self-adjoint elliptic operators, we introduce the stability operator L_v and we characterize stable MOTS in terms of sign conditions on the principal eigenvalue of L_v. The main result shows that given a strictly stable MOTS S contained in one leaf of a given reference foliation in a spacetime, there is an open marginally outer trapped tube (MOTT), adapted to the reference foliation, which contains S. We give conditions under which the MOTT can be completed. Finally, we show that under standard energy conditions on the spacetime, the MOTT must be either locally achronal, spacelike or null.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2889v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
The time evolution of marginally trapped surfaces	Lars Andersson	Marc Mars, Jan Metzger, Walter Simon	2008-11-28 14:07:07	In previous work we have shown the existence of a dynamical horizon or marginally trapped tube (MOTT) containing a given strictly stable marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS). In this paper we show some results on the global behavior of MOTTs assuming the null energy condition. In particular we show that MOTSs persist in the sense that every Cauchy surface in the future of a given Cauchy surface containing a MOTS also must contain a MOTS. We describe a situation where the evolving outermost MOTS must jump during the coalescence of two seperate MOTSs. We furthermore characterize the behavior of MOTSs in the case that the principal eigenvalue vanishes under a genericity assumption. This leads to a regularity result for the tube of outermost MOTSs under the genericity assumption. This tube is then smooth up to finitely many jump times. Finally we discuss the relation of MOTSs to singularities of a space-time.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/26/8/085018	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Single-laser, one beam, tetrahedral magneto-optical trap	Matthieu Vangeleyn	Paul F. Griffin, Erling Riis, Aidan S. Arnold	2009-05-18 14:35:04	We have realised a 4-beam pyramidal magneto-optical trap ideally suited for future microfabrication. Three mirrors split and steer a single incoming beam into a tripod of reflected beams, allowing trapping in the four-beam overlap volume. We discuss the influence of mirror angle on cooling and trapping, finding optimum efficiency in a tetrahedral configuration. We demonstrate the technique using an ex-vacuo mirror system to illustrate the previously inaccessible supra-plane pyramid MOT configuration. Unlike standard pyramidal MOTs both the pyramid apex and its mirror angle are non-critical and our MOT offers improved molasses free from atomic shadows in the laser beams. The MOT scheme naturally extends to a 2-beam refractive version with high optical access. For quantum gas experiments, the mirror system could also be used for a stable 3D tetrahedral optical lattice.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.17.013601	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Anisotropic sub-Doppler laser cooling in dysprosium magneto-optical
  traps"	Seo Ho Youn	Mingwu Lu, Benjamin L. Lev	2010-07-19 19:07:06	Magneto-optical traps (MOTs) of Er and Dy have recently been shown to exhibit population-wide sub-Doppler cooling due to their near degeneracy of excited and ground state Lande g factors. We discuss here an additional, unusual intra-MOT sub-Doppler cooling mechanism that appears when the total Dy MOT cooling laser intensity and magnetic quadrupole gradient increase beyond critical values. Specifically, anisotropically sub-Doppler-cooled cores appear, and their orientation with respect to the quadrupole axis flips at a critical ratio of the MOT laser intensity along the quadrupole axis versus that in the plane of symmetry. This phenomenon can be traced to a loss of the velocity-selective resonance at zero velocity in the cooling force along directions in which the atomic polarization is oriented by the quadrupole field. We present data characterizing this anisotropic laser cooling phenomenon and discuss a qualitative model for its origin based on the extraordinarily large Dy magnetic moment and Dy's near degenerate g factors.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.82.043403	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Tensor triangular geometry of non-commutative motives	Ivo Dell'Ambrogio	Goncalo Tabuada	2011-04-14 13:49:15	In this article we initiate the study of the tensor triangular geometry of the categories Mot(k)_a and Mot(k)_l of non-commutative motives (over a base ring k). Since the full computation of the spectrum of Mot(k)_a and Mot(k)_l seems completely out of reach, we provide some information about the spectrum of certain subcategories. More precisely, we show that when k is a finite field (or its algebraic closure) the spectrum of the monogenic cores Core(k)_a and Core(k)_l (i.e. the thick triangulated subcategories generated by the tensor unit) is closely related to the Zariski spectrum of the integers. Moreover, we prove that if we slightly enlarge Core(k)_a to contain the non-commutative motive associated to the ring of polynomials k[t], and assume that k is a field of characteristic zero, then the corresponding spectrum is richer than the Zariski spectrum of the integers.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2761v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Compactness Theorems and Degree Theory for MOTS	José M. Espinar	Aucun	2011-05-29 17:12:33	We prove in this paper that, under suitable coinditions on an initial data set, we can obtain Area and Curvature Estimates for simple marginally outer trapped surfaces (or MOTS). Using this estimates, we derive a Compactness Theorem for MOTS. Moreover, the Compactness Theorem will allow us to adapt the recent Degree Theory of H. Rosenberg and G. Smith for proving existence results for embedded MOTS in suitable compact initial data sets	http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5805v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
High flux cold Rubidium atomic beam for strongly coupled Cavity QED	Basudev Roy	Michael Scholten	2012-02-15 11:35:46	This paper presents a setup capable of producing a high-flux continuous beam of cold rubidium atoms for cavity QED experiments in the regime of strong coupling. A 2 $D^+$ MOT, loaded by rubidium getters in a dry film coated vapor cell, fed a secondary moving-molasses MOT (MM-MOT) at a rate of 1.5 x $10^{10}$ atoms/sec. The MM-MOT provided a continuous beam with tunable velocity. This beam was then directed through the waist of a 280 $\mu$m cavity resulting in a Rabi splitting of more than +/- 10 MHz. The presence of sufficient number of atoms in the cavity mode also enabled splitting in the polarization perpendicular to the input. The cavity was in the strong coupling regime, with parameters (g, $\kappa$, $\gamma$)/2$\pi$ equal to (7, 3, 6)/ 2$\pi$ MHz.	http://dx.doi.org/10.3938/jkps.61.359	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Creation of Quantum-Degenerate Gases of Ytterbium in a Compact

Our setup does not require a Zeeman slower and offers the flexibility to simultaneously produce ultracold samples of other atomic species. Furthermore, the extraordinary optical access favors future experiments in optical lattices. A 2D-MOT on the strong 1S0-1P1 transition captures ytterbium directly from a dispenser of atoms and loads a 3D-MOT on the narrow 1S0-3P1 intercombination transition. Subsequently, atoms are transferred to a crossed optical dipole trap and cooled evaporatively to quantum degeneracy.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4802682	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Interspecies collision-induced losses in a dual species 7Li-85Rb
  magneto-optical trap"	Sourav Dutta	Adeel Altaf, John Lorenz, D. S. Elliott, Yong P. Chen	2013-06-21 17:07:19	In this article, we report the measurement of collision-induced loss rate coefficients \beta_{Li,Rb} and \beta_{Rb,Li}, and also discuss means to significantly suppress such collision induced losses. We first describe our dual-species magneto-optical trap (MOT) that allows us to simultaneously trap > 5x10^8 7Li atoms loaded from a Zeeman slower and > 2x10^8 85Rb atoms loaded from a dispenser. We observe strong interspecies collision-induced losses in the MOTs which dramatically reduce the maximum atom number achievable in the MOTs. We measure the trap loss rate coefficients \beta_{Li,Rb} and \beta_{Rb,Li}, and, from a study of their dependence on the MOT parameters, determine the cause for the losses observed. Our results provide valuable insights into ultracold collisions between 7Li and 85Rb, guide our efforts to suppress collision induced losses, and also pave the way for the production of ultracold 7Li85Rb molecules.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-4075/47/10/105301	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Mixed order transition and condensation in exactly soluble one
  dimensional spin model"	Amir Bar	David Mukamel	2014-06-24 12:48:56	Mixed order phase transitions (MOT), which display discontinuous order parameter and diverging correlation length, appear in several seemingly unrelated settings ranging from equilibrium models with long-range interactions to models far from thermal equilibrium. In a recent paper [1] an exactly soluble spin model with long-range interactions that exhibits MOT was introduced and analyzed both by a grand canonical calculation and a renormalization group analysis. The model was shown to lay a bridge between two classes of one dimensional models exhibiting MOT, namely between spin models with inverse distance square interactions and surface depinning models. In this paper we elaborate on the calculations done in [1]. We also analyze the model in the canonical ensemble, which yields a better insight into the mechanism of MOT. In addition, we generalize the model to include Potts and general Ising spins, and also consider a broader class of interactions which decay with distance with a power law different from 2.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/2014/11/P11001	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Measurement of low-energy Na^+ -- Na total collision rate in an

Smith	2014-12-16 19:56:47	We present measurements of the total elastic and resonant charge-exchange ion-atom collision rate coefficient $k_\mathrm{ia}$ of cold sodium (\ce{Na}) with optically-dark low energy \ce{Na+} ions in a hybrid ion-neutral trap. To determine $k_\mathrm{ia}$, we measured the trap loading and loss from both a \ce{Na} magneto-optical trap (MOT) and a linear radio frequency quadrupole Paul trap. We found the total rate coefficient to be $7.4 \pm 1.9 \times 10^{-8}$ cm$^3$/s for the type I \ce{Na} MOT immersed within an $\approx 140$ K ion cloud and $1.10 \pm 0.25 \times 10^{-7}$ cm$^3$/s for the type II \ce{Na} MOT within an $\approx 1070$ K ion cloud. Our measurements show excellent agreement with previously reported theoretical fully quantal \textit{ab initio} calculations. In the process of determining the total rate coefficient, we demonstrate that a MOT can be used to probe an optically dark ion cloud's spatial distribution within a hybrid trap.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.91.012709	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Two-Color Magneto-Optical Trap with Small Magnetic Field for Ytterbium	Akio Kawasaki	Boris Braverman, QinQin Yu, Vladan Vuletić	2015-02-25 16:49:04	We report a two-color magneto-optical trap (MOT) for ytterbium atoms operating at a low magnetic field gradient down to 2 G/cm where a conventional MOT using the singlet transition (6s^2 1S0 -> 6s6p 1P1) is unable to trap atoms. By simultaneously applying laser light on both the broad-linewidth singlet transition and the narrow-linewidth triplet transition (6s^2 1S0 -> 6s6p 3P1), we load and trap 4.0 x 10^5 atoms directly from an atomic beam at 700 K. In the two-color MOT, the slowing and trapping functions are separately performed by the singlet transition light and the triplet transition light, respectively. The two-color MOT is highly robust against laser power imbalance even at very low magnetic field gradients.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-4075/48/15/155302	cs	arxiv					0.0

Fluorescence spectra of atoms trapped in a MOT with a passively phase-stabilized beam configuration have been measured by means of the photon-counting heterodyne spectroscopy. We observe a narrow Rayleigh peak and well-resolved Raman sidebands in the fluorescence spectra which clearly show that the MOT itself behaves as a three-dimensional optical lattice. Optical-lattice-like properties of the phase-stabilized MOT such as vibrational frequencies and lineshapes of Rayleigh peak and Raman sidebands are investigated systematically for various trap conditions.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00623v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Collisional cooling of light ions by co-trapped heavy atoms	Sourav Dutta	Rahul Sawant, S. A. Rangwala	2015-12-14 06:58:41	We experimentally demonstrate cooling of trapped ions by collisions with co-trapped, higher mass neutral atoms. It is shown that the lighter $^{39}$K$^{+}$ ions, created by ionizing $^{39}$K atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT), when trapped in an ion trap and subsequently allowed to cool by collisions with ultracold, heavier $^{85}$Rb atoms in a MOT, exhibit a longer trap lifetime than without the localized $^{85}$Rb MOT atoms. A similar cooling of trapped $^{85}$Rb$^{+}$ ions by ultracold $^{133}$Cs atoms in a MOT is also demonstrated in a different experimental configuration to validate this mechanism of ion cooling by localized and centered ultracold neutral atoms. Our results suggest that cooling of ions by localized cold atoms holds for any mass ratio, thereby enabling studies on a wider class of atom-ion systems irrespective of their masses.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.113401	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A versatile dual-species Zeeman slower for caesium and ytterbium	S. A. Hopkins	K. Butler, R. Freytag, A. Guttridge, S. Kemp, E. A. Hinds, M. R. Tarbutt, S. L. Cornish	2015-12-22 12:46:06	We describe the design, construction and operation of a versatile dual-species Zeeman slower for both Cs and Yb, which is easily adaptable for use with other alkali metals and alkaline earths. With the aid of analytic models and numerical simulation of decelerator action, we highlight several real-world problems affecting the performance of a slower and discuss effective solutions. To capture Yb into a magneto-optical trap (MOT), we use the broad $^1S_0$ to $^1P_1$ transition at 399 nm for the slower and the narrow $^1S_0$ to $^3P_1$ intercombination line at 556 nm for the MOT. The Cs MOT and slower both use the D2 line ($6^2S_{1/2}$ to $6^2P_{3/2}$) at 852 nm. We demonstrate that within a few seconds the Zeeman slower loads more than $10^9$ Yb atoms and $10^8$ Cs atoms into their respective MOTs. These are ideal starting numbers for further experiments on ultracold mixtures and molecules.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4945795	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Photodissociation of trapped Rb$^+_2$ : Implications for simultaneous

Rangwala	2016-01-06 09:44:08	The direct photodissociation of trapped $^{85}$Rb$_2^+$ (rubidium) molecular ions by the cooling light for the $^{85}$Rb magneto-optical trap (MOT) is studied, both experimentally and theoretically. Vibrationally excited Rb$_{2}^{+}$ ions are created by photoionization of Rb$_{2}$ molecules formed photoassociatively in the Rb MOT and are trapped in a modified spherical Paul trap. The decay rate of the trapped Rb$_{2}^{+}$ ion signal in the presence of the MOT cooling light is measured and agreement with our calculated rates for molecular ion photodissociation is observed. The photodissociation mechanism due to the MOT light is expected to be active and therefore universal for all homonuclear diatomic alkali metal molecular ions.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.213002	cs	arxiv					0.0

One of the three pairs of 852 nm cooling/trapping beams (CTBs) in a conventional Cs MOT is replaced with a pair of the 1470 nm CTBs (type-I) or with one 852 nm CTB plus another counter-propagating 1470 nm CTB (type-II). Both the type-I and type-II Cs TC-MOTs can cool and trap atoms on both the red- and blue-detuning sides of the two-photon resonance. The Cs TC-MOT demonstrated in this work may have applications in the background-free detection of cooled and trapped atoms, and the photon-pair sources compatible with the ensemble-based quantum memory and the long-distance quantum communication via optical fiber."	http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02746v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Instance Flow Based Online Multiple Object Tracking	Sebastian Bullinger	Christoph Bodensteiner, Michael Arens	2017-03-03 18:54:55	We present a method to perform online Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) of known object categories in monocular video data. Current Tracking-by-Detection MOT approaches build on top of 2D bounding box detections. In contrast, we exploit state-of-the-art instance aware semantic segmentation techniques to compute 2D shape representations of target objects in each frame. We predict position and shape of segmented instances in subsequent frames by exploiting optical flow cues. We define an affinity matrix between instances of subsequent frames which reflects locality and visual similarity. The instance association is solved by applying the Hungarian method. We evaluate different configurations of our algorithm using the MOT 2D 2015 train dataset. The evaluation shows that our tracking approach is able to track objects with high relative motions. In addition, we provide results of our approach on the MOT 2D 2015 test set for comparison with previous works. We achieve a MOTA score of 32.1.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01289v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Blue-detuned magneto-optical trap	K. N. Jarvis	J. A. Devlin, T. E. Wall, B. E. Sauer, M. R. Tarbutt	2017-12-13 20:45:11	We present the properties and advantages of a new magneto-optical trap (MOT) where blue-detuned light drives `type-II' transitions that have dark ground states. Using $^{87}$Rb, we reach a radiation-pressure-limited density exceeding $10^{11}$cm$^{-3}$ and a temperature below 30$\mu$K. The phase-space density is higher than in normal atomic MOTs, and a million times higher than comparable red-detuned type-II MOTs, making it particularly attractive for molecular MOTs which rely on type-II transitions. The loss of atoms from the trap is dominated by ultracold collisions between Rb atoms. For typical trapping conditions, we measure a loss rate of $1.8(4)\times10^{-10}$cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.083201	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"On loading of a magneto-optical trap on an atom-chip with U-wire
  quadrupole field"	Vivek Singh	V. B. Tiwari, K. A. P. Singh, S. R. Mishra	2018-01-29 11:50:26	The role of U-wire generated quadrupole like magnetic field configuration on loading of cold $^{87}Rb$ atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) on atom-chip has been investigated. It is shown by simulations that the quadrupole field profile and the center of the quadrupole field vary depending upon the U-wire current and bias field values. The result of simulations show that the resemblance of generated field configuration to the ideal quadrupole field critically depends on the values of current in U-wire and bias magnetic field. The observed number of trapped atoms in the MOT and its position has also been found to depend on the quadrupole field configuration. The number of trapped atoms in the MOT reaches maximum when the field configuration approaches close to an ideal quadrupole field. This study will help in optimising the number in the MOT before transfer of these cold atoms in the atom-chip wire trap.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09500340.2018.1508772	cs	arxiv					0.0

I recently had my car at a specifc garage for some tyres after having an issue with then and putting through a complaint on conduct and damaging my alloys etc. As it took them 3 weeks to order and fit tyres with them saying they were ready 3 times they compensated me with a free MOT.   The first picture is how the MOT came out.  It feels like it's done entirely out of malice and pettiness as I made the complaint and at least one person had disciplinary action against them.   The second picture is the car now after it got re-mot'd at the next available date by a third party entirely not involved also without me touching the car. I hadn't even watched it as I was dying of a fever shortly after having it MOT'd on the 24th.   Can I get it off my cars history? What's the process with the DVSA? If you've ever dealt with anything similar - please give me your advice on the subject. Should I pursue the garage? Dvsa? Whistle blower site etc.   The car is a 2001 Lexus IS200. Yes I know these cars are prone to rotting from the inside out etc. but this one is a good one hence me caring about the history. Just for extra context it's got a relatively clean MOT history with one a couple advisories at most per test if not clean.

Tjejerna titulerar sig gärna feminister, etc.     Vad är era observationer? Det känns som att det här har växt fram mer och mer på senare år.

Är min sambo otrogen mot mig?	rottenpotato7879	Aucun	2022-08-17 16:27:55	"Ber om ursäkt ifall det här blir långt, behöver skriva av mig och få åsikter från andra. (Throwawaykonto för självklara anledningar)   Lite bakgrundsinfo: Jag och min sambo träffades i gymnasiet och har varit tillsammans i 9 år, bott ihop i 5 år.  Hon har alltid varit lite ""omogen"" men på ett bra sätt, hon är spontan och inte särskilt seriös av sig i allmänhet.   Under den här sommaren har hon börjat umgås med ett nytt kompisgäng, som hon träffat genom en gemensam vän till oss. De här personerna är i åldrarna 18-20, och beter sig som man gör i den åldern (super, tar droger, lever rövare). Det är inte ett problem för mig, då hon får umgås med vem hon vill, men en grej hände nyligen som har gjort mig väldigt orolig och är anledningen till den här tråden.  För två veckor sedan så skulle hon ut och träffa det här gänget på en söndagskväll och supa (hon är arbetslös), jag sa till henne innan hon drog att hon borde hålla sig till alkohol ikväll. Hon verkade inte hålla med men sa ändå ""jaja"", så jag tänkte att det var lugnt. Vid midnatt ringde jag till henne för att säga godnatt och kolla så allt gick bra, men fick inget svar. Så jag skickade iväg ett sms i stil med ""Jag går och lägger mig nu, hoppas du har det kul, godnatt"". När jag vaknade vid 6 på morgonen så hade jag fortfarande inte fått något svar, så jag försökte ringa henne igen men återigen kom det bara signaler. Vid lunchtid så ringde hon mig och sa att jag måste komma och hämta henne hos en kompis för hon vill hem, så jag åkte iväg när min lunchrast började. På vägen hem satt hon väldigt tyst och ville inte prata alls om vad som hade hänt under natten, sen somnade hon i princip direkt när vi kom hem. Åkte tillbaka till jobbet och när jag kom hem på kvällen sov hon fortfarande. Jag frågade henne när hon vaknade vad som hade hänt och då sa hon att de bara hade festat länge och hon var upptagen så därför hon inte svarade när jag ringde. Jag lät det bara vara för jag inte ville starta något bråk.  Fredagen därpå på kvällen bad hon mig skjutsa henne till den där kompisen igen, så då gjorde jag det. När jag släppte av henne möttes hon av två killar i porten som båda två kramade henne, och ena killen tog henne på rumpan. Jag vill inte tro något dåligt om henne och antog bara att det var lite ""vänskapligt"" sådär. Sen skickade hon iväg ett sms senare på kvällen att hon kommer sova kvar, och jag får hämta henne imorgon istället. Inget annat särskilt hände, jag bara hämtade henne på eftermiddagen sen och allt verkade lugnt.  Jag känner bara att hela situationen är lite skum, men jag vill så gärna att jag ska ha fel. Jag litar på henne till fullo, men det börjar bli för mycket för mig nu. Har ni varit i liknande situationer, och vad gjorde ni i så fall? Jag känner mig helt lost. Jag hoppas att jag överreagerar."	https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/wqtdjc/är_min_sambo_otrogen_mot_mig/		reddit	wqtdjc	sweden	840.0	840.0	658.0

Manifestation mot religiöst våld?	0OOO00000OO00O0O0OOO	Aucun	2023-10-17 10:54:41	"Är det inte hög tid att organisera en manifestation mot religiöst våld? Även om roten till problemet kan vara mångfacetterad, är det ofta religion som blir katalysatorn för våldshandlingar i samhället. Just nu fokuseras mycket på islam, men att peka ut en enskild religion gynnar ingen. Det riskerar bara att skapa polarisering och avståndstagande.  Genom att vara generella och enade i kampen mot religiöst våld kan vi dra till oss anhängare från alla trosriktningar, samt de som är ickereligiösa. Tillsammans kan vi stå axel mot axel i denna gemensamma strävan.  Att bekämpa religion i sig är meningslöst, eftersom majoriteten inom alla trosinriktningar faktiskt fördömer våld. Det är viktigt att detta blir synligt.  Tänk er en protest där alla bär med sig sina religiösa symboler och nationsflaggor. Tillsammans visar vi hur mångfald och tolerans ska praktiseras. Vårt gemensamma mål? Att utrota våld kopplat till religion, utan att döma någon. Förändringen måste komma inifrån.  Samhället är på bristningsgränsen och det är hjärtskärande att bevittna. Det bästa sättet att vända trenden är genom att sprida godhet och tolerans. Trots våra olika åsikter och livsåskådningar är vi i grund och botten alla bara ""nakenapor"" som mestadels kan leva i harmoni. Men det vi absolut inte kan tolerera är våld, och särskilt religiöst våld måste vi ta tag i, eftersom det är en del av ett större system. Det är dags att agera."	https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/179vmru/manifestation_mot_religiöst_våld/		reddit	179vmru	sweden	287.0	287.0	166.0	
Varför är ni dryga mot kassa personal?	hejsanfina	Aucun	2023-09-16 18:53:13	KASSAPERSONAL*   Denna är riktad till er som inte hälsar på kassapersonalen, som inte säger tack eller ha en bra dag. Varför gör ni så?   Många i min omgivning tror att det är så skönt att sitta i kassan då man bara ”sitter” nej hela ryggen gör ont, axlarna, huvudet, sociala batteriet tar slut, kunder som bråkar med en och otrevliga människor.   Ni som är snälla gör hela min dag, jag brukar till och med ge ut gratis påsar till er <3   En annan sak som jag måste ta upp är att snälla tänk på att lägga streckkoden mot dig i kassan för att underlätta för både mig och dig, det går snabbare o skanna och dina varor hamnar inte huller om buller när du packar dom. Ni som slänger varor på varor så att det blir en hög, varorna ramlar bara och det blir jobbigt för oss kassapersonalen att jobba effektivt. Vi uppskattar det mer än vad ni tror när ni har ordning och reda på varorna och speciellt när ni lägger streckkoden mot oss.  Ni som inte hälsar, varför? Jag vill verkligen verkligen verkligen ha svar på den frågan, ni som säger att ni inte orkar säga hej, va? Det är bokstavligen bara ett ord som är jättekort. Vissa kastar till och med pengarna på en eller lägger de på kassabandet, det är inte svårt att bara ge pengarna i handen.   Ni som pratar i telefonen när ni betalar, känns lite respektlöst ni svarar inte på det vi säger och när jag frågar om ni vill ha kvittot tar ni den bara utan o tänka på om ni vill ha den eller inte för ni är så ouppmärksammade på det som händer runt omkring er.    En till sak är ni som bråkar om priserna eller ni som säger men den kostar ju 10 kronor när det står 10,95. Ska jag behöva förklara vad ören är nu också? Sen är det inte vi som lägger priserna, bråka med den som är butiksansvarig inte mig. Tack!   Det har hänt några gånger att kunder har skrikit på mig. En kund ville ha en Sverigelott han var en sån dryg typ som inte ens ler eller hälsar, han pekade på en liten bild vid min kassa och sa ”den”  och jag såg inte ens bilden då frågar jag vad menar du och jag försökte verkligen förstå honom, jag pekade på så många saker för att fråga om det var den han menade, sen skriker han ”HALLÅ DEN” då förstod jag att han ville ha en lott, sen betalar han och så sa ”JAG SA TVÅ ÄR DU DUM” måste bara tillägga att han sa bara ”HALLÅ DEN” när jag ska ge han en till lott går han iväg utan att betala sen sa jag hallå ska du inte betala då skrek han ”JAG LA PENGARNA DÄR” de var vid kassabandet….	https://www.reddit.com/r/Asksweddit/comments/16kf0cy/varför_är_ni_dryga_mot_kassa_personal/		reddit	16kf0cy	Asksweddit	309.0	309.0	351.0

Min tjej var otrogen mot mig under lumpen	GreatHighlight8504	Aucun	2023-08-29 23:17:25	Edit: Jag är obeskrivligt tacksam för alla som tagit sig tiden till att läsa,skriva en kommentar och skrivit pm. Det betyder otroligt mycket för mig och jag känner att Ni har varit till en stor hjälp. Tack!🤩😃🙏   För att inte vara allt för långrandig hoppar jag direkt till hur allt började.   Min tjej visste att jag väldigt gärna ville göra värnplikten. Sagt och gjort blev jag antagen och när det var dags för inryck pratade vi om hur det kan påverka våran relation. Hon var väldigt förstående och stöttande i att jag följde min dröm.   Tiden gick och jag ryckte in. Där jag gjorde värnplikten såg permissionschema såg ut enligt följande: inne 12 dagar hemma 2 och en halv dag.  På den korta tiden man är hemma ville jag bl a vara med henne, träffa mina vänner, familj och kanske viktigast av allt att få återhämta mig. Som ni förstår är det mycket man vill göra på för lite tid. För övrigt både vi på varsin sida om stan (Stockholm), och hon har inget körkort. Vilket krånglar till det- men ingenting är omöjligt.   Problemet uppstod när jag ville göra allt det ovannämnda men kan inte pga tidsbrist, jag måste prioritera. Och visst, jag förstår hennes känsla att jag inte prioriterade henne tillräckligt mycket och gav henne för lite av uppmärksamhet och kärlek som hon förtjänade. Men å andra sidan kan jag inte åsidosätta allt annat för bara henne.  Efter en del tjafs och bråk tog vi oss igenom månad för månad och fram mot våren såg vi ljust i tunneln och hoppet för våran relation/framtid. Vi pratade en del om vad vi skulle göra i sommar och hur kul vi kommer ha det när jag har mer tid för henne.   Men innan vi når fram dit kommer Aurora 23. En tid innan förklara jag för henne att jag kommer vara ute i ca 3 veckor och med största sannolikhet kommer hon inte höra någonting från mig. Hon är inställd och medveten om att det kommer bli tufft för oss båda men vi har klarat oss såhär långt. Så varför skulle det här stoppa oss?  Då kom käftsmällen samma kväll som jag var på väg tillbaka till regementet för att delta på Aurora 23 fick jag reda på att hon har varit otrogen. Jag blev helt förkrossad och ringde henne gång på gång, utan något svar. Senare under kvällen fick jag tag på och sa att vi måste prata. Det här känns inte bra. Självklart ringer hon aldrig och hon svarar inte på mig heller. Så där ligger jag i min säng gråtandes och helt förkrossad dagen innan jag ska iväg på en över 3 veckor lång övning utan någon som helst kontakt med henne. Dagen efter försöker jag i panik få tag på henne men lyckas bara dra i väg ett meddelande om att jag älskar henne trots vetskapen om att hon är otrogen.  Det var många gånger jag tänkte på henne under Aurora och saknade henne. Det blev en hel del övertänkande och ältande. Samtidigt som att jag vägrade acceptera att det inte skulle vara samma som innan.  När jag väl kommer hem efter Aurora träffas vi. Vi pratar ut om det och det känns okej.  Trots att hon var otrogen mot mig har jag väldigt svårt att släppa henne. Allt var så perfekt när det väl fungerar vi hade så roligt tillsammans och kunde prata om precis allt. Jag såg framför mig att vi hade hela livet kvar tillsammans.  Igår tar det en ny vändning. Då ringer hon mig precis när jag ska gå och lägga mig och är helt förkrossad och i affekt. Då berättar hon att killen hon var tillsammans med varit otrogen mot henne och att hon nyss blivit dumpad och lämnad. Min första fråga är då, varför ringer du till mig för? det var ju slut för flera månader sedan? Men enligt henne har hon ingen kvar som bryr sig om henne, och hon (anser jag) gör sig själv till offret och vill att jag ska stötta henne. Snäll som jag är hjälper jag henne då jag fortfarande inte släppt henne.   Det jag undrar/behöver stöttning i är vad borde jag göra för att gå vidare och hur borde jag hantera det?	https://www.reddit.com/r/Asksweddit/comments/164xuxj/min_tjej_var_otrogen_mot_mig_under_lumpen/		reddit	164xuxj	Asksweddit	325.0	325.0	491.0

Forbud mot fyrverkeri	joakimk84	Aucun	2023-01-01 12:33:40	Hvorfor er vi som befolkning så motvillige til å forby fyrverkeri?     I dag er min feed på FB full av dyr som har klart å rømme i går, utallige bilder og videoer av dyr som viser veldig tydelig tegn til frykt på grunn av rakettene. Jeg leste også om noen som fyrte av raketter mot hund fra bil. Jeg hører også vært år om hest, kyr, sau og mange andre dyr som har stukket av, skadet seg og dødd på grunn av raketter. Og villdyr har det ikke noe bedre.     Når jeg spør folk om hvorfor de er så imot forbud får jeg aldri noe skikkelig svar, bare tullekommentarer. Kan noen komme med et skikkelig svar?	https://www.reddit.com/r/norge/comments/100ipwk/forbud_mot_fyrverkeri/		reddit	100ipwk	norge	226.0	226.0	481.0	Spørsmål

Min skygga katt strök sig mot mig för första gången!	Successful-Quote8204	Aucun	2023-10-18 03:09:49	För ett och ett halvt år sedan adopterade jag en katt. Hon hade gått från hem till hem och varje gång hade folk blivit besvikna på att hon inte vågade närma sig så de kunde kela med henne.   När jag fick henne och tiden första året var hon skvätträdd och spratt till så fort man rörde sig eller gjorde något ljud. Jag skrämde henne när jag gick, när jag stannade, när jag plockade upp saker, när jag satte ner saker, när jag tog en annan väg än jag brukar etc.  Senaste halvåret har hon verkar tryggare. Inte lika lättskrämd, bara försiktig.  Senaste dagarna har jag hittat henne väntandes utanför mitt rum när jag vaknar på morgonen. Hon tittade på mig och strök sig mot golv och väggar som om det var menat för mig.  Det har hon gjort nu i några dagar och i morse tog hon steget och närmade sig helt. Hon borstade till mig med svansen lite lätt.  Efter det var det som att något släppte. Hon gjorde mig en halvtimme sen till gymmet för att hon inte ville sluta komma fram till mig och stryka hela sin kropp fram och tillbaka längs mina ben.   Idag kommer vara en bra dag!

Jag hetsade mot folkgrupp?	-mindtrix-	Aucun	2022-03-17 20:01:46	Pratade med min muslimske granne i vårt gemensamma gym. Vi brukar alltid snacka en stund och kom osökt in på Ukrainakrisen. Jag nämnde att jag ansåg att tjetjenierna betedde sig märkligt då de själva varit utsatta för ungefär samma sak som ukrainarna av ryssarna och nu vill de kriga på Rysslands sida (ja, jag vet att deras ledare är en marionett osv).  Grannen nämnde att det snart var fasta och att det är tufft att kriga på tom mage men profeten hade ju klarat av det på sin tid. Lite skämtsamt kläckte jag ur mig att han kanske fuskat och ätit en Snickers (ett uppenbart skämt).  Det togs inte emot väl och jag märkte direkt att jag sagt något fel så jag frågade om jag vanhedrat profeten och det hade jag tydligen. Jag bad om ursäkt om jag gjort grannen upprörd och sa att det bara var ett dåligt skämt men det spelade såklart ingen roll. Han tyckte bara jag gjorde det värre och sa att vi snart skulle hamna i handgemäng om jag inte slutade och att det var hets mot folkgrupp som jag ägnade mig åt. Jag ifrågasatte det men insåg snart att det nog var bäst att vara tyst då han inte verkade vilja diskutera saken vidare.  Jag är ganska skämtsamt lagd och skojar om det mesta. Jag förklarade även att min intentionen inte var av ondo men det var tydligen inte väsentligt.  Har jag verkligen hetsat mot folkgrupp i mitt scenario?  Borde jag skämmas för min nonchalans/okunskap/klumpighet?  Hela situationen kändes olustig och även om jag är väldigt mån om yttrandefriheten så vill jag inte kränka någon i onödan vilket jag uppenbarligen gjorde :(	https://www.reddit.com/r/swedishproblems/comments/tgivj2/jag_hetsade_mot_folkgrupp/		reddit	tgivj2	swedishproblems	756.0	756.0	264.0

Hat mot legalisering/avkriminalisering av sexhandel och droger	Hiplobbe	Aucun	2022-08-20 10:52:56	Varför är det generellt så att Svenskar hatar idén om legalt sexköp/droghandel?  Att man ogillar de kriminella elementen bakom förstår jag, men isåfall borde man vara drivande på avkriminalisering och vissa fall även legalisering (för att t.ex. förbättra arbetsvillkoren för sexarbetare eller minska gängens tillgångar).  Varför är det ett sådant starkt förakt för avkriminalisering/legalisering?	https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/wt493a/hat_mot_legaliseringavkriminalisering_av/		reddit	wt493a	sweden	393.0	393.0	1051.0

Le mot racisme est beaucoup trop utilisé à tout va et sans raison.	sgtyarrick	Aucun	2023-09-10 15:07:22	"On entend ce mot tous les jours à notre époque. Par manque de connaissance, de réflexion ou juste de logique, ou bien afin de se donner un rôle, le mot racisme est souvent utilisé à tord.  Pour rappel, le racisme implique 2 affirmations. La première étant qu'il existe des ""races"" la 2ème étant qu'il existe une hiérarchie entre elles ou que certaines soient discriminé par des paroles par exemple.  Et parceque la différence est une force, il faut savoir accepté les avantages culturelle qui nous sont propres mais aussi les défauts.  Le problème, c'est qu'à trop utilisé ce mot, il perd de sa valeur et que, finalement, sa dénonciation perd de son impact... ce qui est non seulement dommage mais en plus déssert la cause"	https://www.reddit.com/r/opinionnonpopulaire/comments/16f2kiz/le_mot_racisme_est_beaucoup_trop_utilisé_à_tout/		reddit	16f2kiz	opinionnonpopulaire	521.0	521.0	405.0	
Le « mot en f »	redalastor	Aucun	2023-06-09 00:34:20	Depuis à peu près une heure, reddit cache les commentaires qui envoient chier le CEO de reddit et même les mods ne peuvent plus les afficher. Ce n’est pas nous qui censurent ça.  Il est donc considéré préférable de le faire en français.  Va chier Steve Huffman !

Psilocybin behandling mot depression?	Mobile_Instruction41	Aucun	2023-08-27 18:59:43	Efter 10+ år av antideppresiva piller är jag mer än redo att testa något nytt som kanske hjälper bättre.  Man läser mer och mer i media om att behandlingar med  svampen psilocybin (toppslätsskivling) kan förbättra och till och med bota folks depressioner. I Sverige är detta dock fortfarande under forskning och ej en laglig behandling än så länge. Jag undrar om någon här har prövat en liknande behandling fast någonstans i Europa?  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  EDIT:  Tack så mycket för alla rekommendationer och många kloka ord! Nu har jag mycket research att göra. Tack!	https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/162ys4g/psilocybin_behandling_mot_depression/		reddit	162ys4g	sweden	40.0	40.0	176.0

Siden det nå blir forbud mot engangs bestikk og lav kvalitets plastikk, hvorfor innføres det ikke da også forbud mot uadressert reklame i postkassa?	pisedoff111	Aucun	2021-07-06 11:54:00	"Det tjener jo et enda mindre formål. Det går jo bare direkte fra postkassa til søppeldunken.  Det er jo absolutt ingen som ønsker denne reklamen, og at man trenger en klistrelapp for å si at man ikke interessert er jo ganske tilbakestående. Nesten like idiotisk og miljø fiendtlig som julepapir.  Så hva med innføre et forbud mot uadressert reklame, så kan heller de som er interessert i det skaffe en egen klistrelapp som sier ""Ja takk til uadressert reklame""."	https://www.reddit.com/r/norge/comments/oete11/siden_det_nå_blir_forbud_mot_engangs_bestikk_og/		reddit	oete11	norge	1366.0	1366.0	217.0	Diskusjon
