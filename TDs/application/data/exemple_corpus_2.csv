The Rise of Quantum Internet Computing	Seng W. Loke	Aucun	2022-08-01 10:36:13	This article highlights quantum Internet computing as referring to distributed quantum computing over the quantum Internet, analogous to (classical) Internet computing involving (classical) distributed computing over the (classical) Internet. Relevant to quantum Internet computing would be areas of study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum information for computations, quantum cloud computing, delegated verifiable blind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum applications, over Internet-scale distances.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00733v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices	Seth Lloyd	Aucun	2000-03-31 22:07:23	This paper investigates a variety of unconventional quantum computation devices, including fermionic quantum computers and computers that exploit nonlinear quantum mechanics.

Geometrical perspective on quantum states and quantum computation	Zeqian Chen	Aucun	2013-11-20 02:23:12	We interpret quantum computing as a geometric evolution process by reformulating finite quantum systems via Connes' noncommutative geometry. In this formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections, while gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum operations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented, which is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric way of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative proposal of building a quantum computer.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4939v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Quantum Computation and Quantum Information	Yazhen Wang	Aucun	2012-10-02 11:47:37	Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will likely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication, computation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and quantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much faster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical framework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/11-STS378	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Probabilistic Process Algebra to Unifying Quantum and Classical
  Computing in Closed Systems"	Yong Wang	Aucun	2016-10-08 08:48:09	We have unified quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems called qACP which is a quantum generalization of process algebra ACP. But, an axiomatization for quantum and classical processes with an assumption of closed quantum systems is still missing. For closed quantum systems, unitary operator, quantum measurement and quantum entanglement are three basic components for quantum computing. This leads to probability unavoidable. Along the solution of qACP to unify quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems, we unify quantum and classical computing with an assumption of closed systems under the framework of ACP-like probabilistic process algebra. This unification make it can be used widely in verification for quantum and classical computing mixed systems, such as most quantum communication protocols.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02500v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Optimal Stochastic Resource Allocation for Distributed Quantum Computing	Napat Ngoenriang	Minrui Xu, Sucha Supittayapornpong, Dusit Niyato, Han Yu, Xuemin, Shen	2022-09-16 02:37:32	With the advent of interconnected quantum computers, i.e., distributed quantum computing (DQC), multiple quantum computers can now collaborate via quantum networks to perform massively complex computational tasks. However, DQC faces problems sharing quantum information because it cannot be cloned or duplicated between quantum computers. Thanks to advanced quantum mechanics, quantum computers can teleport quantum information across quantum networks. However, challenges to utilizing efficiently quantum resources, e.g., quantum computers and quantum channels, arise in DQC due to their capabilities and properties, such as uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for DQC based on stochastic programming to minimize the total deployment cost for quantum resources. Essentially, the two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated to handle the uncertainty of quantum computing demands, computing power, and fidelity in quantum networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and ability of the proposed scheme to balance the utilization of quantum computers and on-demand quantum computers while minimizing the overall cost of provisioning under uncertainty.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02886v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Duality quantum computer and the efficient quantum simulations	Shi-Jie Wei	Gui-Lu Long	2015-07-12 07:50:13	In this paper, we firstly briefly review the duality quantum computer. Distinctly, the generalized quantum gates, the basic evolution operators in a duality quantum computer are no longer unitary, and they can be expressed in terms of linear combinations of unitary operators. All linear bounded operators can be realized in a duality quantum computer, and unitary operators are just the extreme points of the set of generalized quantum gates. A d-slits duality quantum computer can be realized in an ordinary quantum computer with an additional qudit using the duality quantum computing mode. Duality quantum computer provides flexibility and clear physical picture in designing quantum algorithms, serving as a useful bridge between quantum and classical algorithms. In this review, we will show that duality quantum computer can simulate quantum systems more efficiently than ordinary quantum computers by providing descriptions of the recent efficient quantum simulation algorithms of Childs et al [Quantum Information & Computation, 12(11-12): 901-924 (2012)] for the fast simulation of quantum systems with a sparse Hamiltonian, and the quantum simulation algorithm by Berry et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 090502 (2015)], which provides exponential improvement in precision for simulating systems with a sparse Hamiltonian.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03200v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A Note on Bulk Quantum Turing Machine	Tetsushi Matsui	Aucun	2004-11-12 18:56:15	Recently, among experiments for realization of quantum computers, NMR quantum computers have achieved the most impressive succession. There is a model of the NMR quantum computation,namely Atsumi and Nishino's bulk quantum Turing Machine. It assumes, however, an unnatural assumption with quantum mechanics. We, then, define a more natural and quantum mechanically realizable modified bulk quantum Turing Machine, and show its computational ability by comparing complexity classes with quantum Turing Machine's counter part.	http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0411037v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Pulse controlled noise suppressed quantum computation	Lu-Ming Duan	Guang-Can Guo	1998-07-26 10:23:48	To make arbitrarily accurate quantum computation possible, practical realization of quantum computers will require suppressing noise in quantum memory and gate operations to make it below a threshold value.

"From Distributed Quantum Computing to Quantum Internet Computing: an
  Overview"	Seng W. Loke	Aucun	2022-08-22 07:58:59	The possibility of quantum computing has been proposed decades ago, at least as far back as the 1980s, and distributed quantum computing has been studied around two decades ago. Recent times have seen experimental successes and advances in quantum computer hardware and in quantum networking, leading towards the quantum Internet. We provide in this paper an overview of concepts and ideas in distributed quantum computing since over two decades ago as well as look at recent efforts in the area, and consider how, with the development of the quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing is evolving into quantum Internet computing.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10127v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Quantum Cybernetics and Complex Quantum Systems Science - A Quantum
  Connectionist Exploration"	Carlos Pedro Gonçalves	Aucun	2014-02-05 19:48:24	Quantum cybernetics and its connections to complex quantum systems science is addressed from the perspective of complex quantum computing systems. In this way, the notion of an autonomous quantum computing system is introduced in regards to quantum artificial intelligence, and applied to quantum artificial neural networks, considered as autonomous quantum computing systems, which leads to a quantum connectionist framework within quantum cybernetics for complex quantum computing systems. Several examples of quantum feedforward neural networks are addressed in regards to Boolean functions' computation, multilayer quantum computation dynamics, entanglement and quantum complementarity. The examples provide a framework for a reflection on the role of quantum artificial neural networks as a general framework for addressing complex quantum systems that perform network-based quantum computation, possible consequences are drawn regarding quantum technologies, as well as fundamental research in complex quantum systems science and quantum biology.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1141v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
An Introduction to Quantum Computing	Noson S. Yanofsky	Aucun	2007-08-02 02:50:42	Quantum Computing is a new and exciting field at the intersection of mathematics, computer science and physics. It concerns a utilization of quantum mechanics to improve the efficiency of computation. Here we present a gentle introduction to some of the ideas in quantum computing. The paper begins by motivating the central ideas of quantum mechanics and quantum computation with simple toy models. From there we move on to a formal presentation of the small fraction of (finite dimensional) quantum mechanics that we will need for basic quantum computation. Central notions of quantum architecture (qubits and quantum gates) are described. The paper ends with a presentation of one of the simplest quantum algorithms: Deutsch's algorithm. Our presentation demands neither advanced mathematics nor advanced physics.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0261v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Quantum Computing via The Bethe Ansatz	Yong Zhang	Aucun	2011-06-20 18:24:51	We recognize quantum circuit model of computation as factorisable scattering model and propose that a quantum computer is associated with a quantum many-body system solved by the Bethe ansatz. As an typical example to support our perspectives on quantum computation, we study quantum computing in one-dimensional nonrelativistic system with delta-function interaction, where the two-body scattering matrix satisfies the factorisation equation (the quantum Yang--Baxter equation) and acts as a parametric two-body quantum gate. We conclude by comparing quantum computing via the factorisable scattering with topological quantum computing.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11128-011-0268-4	cs	arxiv					0.0	
How to Compute Using Quantum Walks	Viv Kendon	Aucun	2020-04-03 01:51:03	Quantum walks are widely and successfully used to model diverse physical processes. This leads to computation of the models, to explore their properties. Quantum walks have also been shown to be universal for quantum computing. This is a more subtle result than is often appreciated, since it applies to computations run on qubit-based quantum computers in the single walker case, and physical quantum walks in the multi-walker case (quantum cellular automata). Nonetheless, quantum walks are powerful tools for quantum computing when correctly applied. In this paper, I explain the relationship between quantum walks as models and quantum walks as computational tools, and give some examples of their application in both contexts.	http://dx.doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.315.1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A Uniform Quantum Computing Model Based on Virtual Quantum Processors	George Gesek	Aucun	2023-02-24 17:07:37	Quantum Computers, one fully realized, can represent an exponential boost in computing power. However, the computational power of the current quantum computers, referred to as Noisy Internediate Scale Quantum, or NISQ, is severely limited because of environmental and intrinsic noise, as well as the very low connectivity between qubits compared to their total amount. We propose a virtual quantum processor that emulates a generic hybrid quantum machine which can serve as a logical version of quantum computing hardware. This hybrid classical quantum machine powers quantum-logical computations which are substitutable by future native quantum processors.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICWS53863.2021.00018	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Quantum Computational Supremacy	Aram W Harrow	Ashley Montanaro	2018-09-20 01:31:16	The field of quantum algorithms aims to find ways to speed up the solution of computational problems by using a quantum computer. A key milestone in this field will be when a universal quantum computer performs a computational task that is beyond the capability of any classical computer, an event known as quantum supremacy. This would be easier to achieve experimentally than full-scale quantum computing, but involves new theoretical challenges. Here we present the leading proposals to achieve quantum supremacy, and discuss how we can reliably compare the power of a classical computer to the power of a quantum computer.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature23458	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Integrable Quantum Computation	Yong Zhang	Aucun	2011-11-16 20:44:35	Integrable quantum computation is defined as quantum computing via the integrable condition, in which two-qubit gates are either nontrivial unitary solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation or the Swap gate (permutation). To make the definition clear, in this article, we explore the physics underlying the quantum circuit model, and then present a unified description on both quantum computing via the Bethe ansatz and quantum computing via the Yang--Baxter equation.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3940v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Quantum computer: an appliance for playing market games	Edward W. Piotrowski	Jan Sladkowski	2003-05-05 07:12:35	Recent development in quantum computation and quantum information theory allows to extend the scope of game theory for the quantum world. The authors have recently proposed a quantum description of financial market in terms of quantum game theory. The paper contain an analysis of such markets that shows that there would be advantage in using quantum computers and quantum strategies.	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0305017v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Phase Information in Quantum Oracle Computing	J. Machta	Aucun	1998-05-07 20:50:15	Computational devices may be supplied with external sources of information (oracles). Quantum oracles may transmit phase information which is available to a quantum computer but not a classical computer. One consequence of this observation is that there is an oracle which is of no assistance to a classical computer but which allows a quantum computer to solve undecidable problems. Thus useful relativized separations between quantum and classical complexity classes must exclude the transmission of phase information from oracle to computer.	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9805022v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Multiparty Delegated Quantum Computing	Elham Kashefi	Anna Pappa	2016-06-29 17:47:53	Quantum computing has seen tremendous progress in the past years. However, due to limitations in scalability of quantum technologies, it seems that we are far from constructing universal quantum computers for everyday users. A more feasible solution is the delegation of computation to powerful quantum servers on the network. This solution was proposed in previous studies of Blind Quantum Computation, with guarantees for both the secrecy of the input and of the computation being performed. In this work, we further develop this idea of computing over encrypted data, to propose a multiparty delegated quantum computing protocol in the measurement-based quantum computing framework.	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cryptography1020012	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Covert Quantum Internet	Kamil Bradler	George Siopsis, Alex Wozniakowski	2017-04-24 15:25:18	We apply covert quantum communication based on entanglement generated from the Minkowski vacuum to the setting of quantum computation and quantum networks. Our approach hides the generation and distribution of entanglement in quantum networks by taking advantage of relativistic quantum effects. We devise a suite of covert quantum teleportation protocols that utilize the shared entanglement, local operations, and covert classical communication to transfer or process quantum information in stealth. As an application of our covert suite, we construct two prominent examples of measurement-based quantum computation, namely the teleportation-based quantum computer and the one-way quantum computer. In the latter case we explore the covert generation of graph states, and subsequently outline a protocol for the covert implementation of universal blind quantum computation.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07281v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Why now is the right time to study quantum computing	Aram W. Harrow	Aucun	2014-12-30 21:00:25	Quantum computing is a good way to justify difficult physics experiments. But until quantum computers are built, do computer scientists need to know anything about quantum information? In fact, quantum computing is not merely a recipe for new computing devices, but a new way of looking at the world that has been astonishingly intellectually productive. In this article, I'll talk about where quantum computing came from, what it is, and what we can learn from it.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2090276.2090288	cs	arxiv					0.0	
What is a quantum computer, and how do we build one?	Carlos A. Perez-Delgado	Pieter Kok	2009-06-24 13:14:20	The DiVincenzo criteria for implementing a quantum computer have been seminal in focussing both experimental and theoretical research in quantum information processing. These criteria were formulated specifically for the circuit model of quantum computing. However, several new models for quantum computing (paradigms) have been proposed that do not seem to fit the criteria well. The question is therefore what are the general criteria for implementing quantum computers. To this end, a formal operational definition of a quantum computer is introduced. It is then shown that according to this definition a device is a quantum computer if it obeys the following four criteria: Any quantum computer must (1) have a quantum memory; (2) facilitate a controlled quantum evolution of the quantum memory; (3) include a method for cooling the quantum memory; and (4) provide a readout mechanism for subsets of the quantum memory. The criteria are met when the device is scalable and operates fault-tolerantly. We discuss various existing quantum computing paradigms, and how they fit within this framework. Finally, we lay out a roadmap for selecting an avenue towards building a quantum computer. This is summarized in a decision tree intended to help experimentalists determine the most natural paradigm given a particular physical implementation.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.83.012303	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Fault-Tolerant Postselected Quantum Computation: Threshold Analysis	E. Knill	Aucun	2004-04-19 21:17:56	The schemes for fault-tolerant postselected quantum computation given in [Knill, Fault-Tolerant Postselected Quantum Computation: Schemes, http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402171] are analyzed to determine their error-tolerance. The analysis is based on computer-assisted heuristics. It indicates that if classical and quantum communication delays are negligible, then scalable qubit-based quantum computation is possible with errors above 1% per elementary quantum gate.	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404104v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Continuous Variable Quantum Algorithms: an Introduction	Samantha Buck	Robin Coleman, Hayk Sargsyan	2021-07-05 17:26:25	Quantum computing is usually associated with discrete quantum states and physical quantities possessing discrete eigenvalue spectrum. However, quantum computing in general is any computation accomplished by the exploitation of quantum properties of physical quantities, discrete or otherwise. It has been shown that physical quantities with continuous eigenvalue spectrum can be used for quantum computing as well. Currently, continuous variable quantum computing is a rapidly developing field both theoretically and experimentally. In this pedagogical introduction we present the basic theoretical concepts behind it and the tools for algorithm development. The paper targets readers with discrete quantum computing background, who are new to continuous variable quantum computing.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02151v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Efficient Quantum Transforms	Peter Hoyer	Aucun	1997-02-12 00:52:17	Quantum mechanics requires the operation of quantum computers to be unitary, and thus makes it important to have general techniques for developing fast quantum algorithms for computing unitary transforms. A quantum routine for computing a generalized Kronecker product is given. Applications include re-development of the networks for computing the Walsh-Hadamard and the quantum Fourier transform. New networks for two wavelet transforms are given. Quantum computation of Fourier transforms for non-Abelian groups is defined. A slightly relaxed definition is shown to simplify the analysis and the networks that computes the transforms. Efficient networks for computing such transforms for a class of metacyclic groups are introduced. A novel network for computing a Fourier transform for a group used in quantum error-correction is also given.	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9702028v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Quantum Computing Using Crossed Atomic Beams	P. Blythe	B. Varcoe	2006-05-22 10:54:05	A quantum computer is a hypothetical device in which the laws of quantum mechanics are used to introduce a degree of parallelism into computations and which could therefore significantly improve on the computational speed of a classical computer at certain tasks. Cluster state quantum computing (recently proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel) is a new paradigm in quantum information processing and is a departure from the conventional model of quantum computation. The cluster state quantum computer begins by creating a highly entangled multi-particle state (the cluster state) which it uses as a quantum resource during the computation. Information is processed in the computer via selected measurements on individual qubits that form the cluster state. We describe in detail how a scalable quantum computer can be constructed using microwave cavity QED and, in a departure from the traditional understanding of a computer as a fixed array of computational elements, we show that cluster state quantum computing is well suited to atomic beam experiments. We show that all of the necessary elements have been individually realised, and that the construction of a truly scalable atomic beam quantum computer may be an experimental reality in the near future.	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605190v2	cs	arxiv					0.0

"DQC$^2$O: Distributed Quantum Computing for Collaborative Optimization
  in Future Networks"	Napat Ngoenriang	Minrui Xu, Jiawen Kang, Dusit Niyato, Han Yu, Xuemin, Shen	2022-09-16 02:44:52	With the advantages of high-speed parallel processing, quantum computers can efficiently solve large-scale complex optimization problems in future networks. However, due to the uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise, distributed quantum computing which relies on quantum networks connected through entanglement faces a lot of challenges for exchanging information across quantum computers. In this paper, we propose an adaptive distributed quantum computing approach to manage quantum computers and quantum channels for solving optimization tasks in future networks. Firstly, we describe the fundamentals of quantum computing and its distributed concept in quantum networks. Secondly, to address the uncertainty of future demands of collaborative optimization tasks and instability over quantum networks, we propose a quantum resource allocation scheme based on stochastic programming for minimizing quantum resource consumption. Finally, based on the proposed approach, we discuss the potential applications for collaborative optimization in future networks, such as smart grid management, IoT cooperation, and UAV trajectory planning. Promising research directions that can lead to the design and implementation of future distributed quantum computing frameworks are also highlighted.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02887v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Quantum Chaos & Quantum Computers	D. L. Shepelyansky	Aucun	2000-06-15 17:47:14	The standard generic quantum computer model is studied analytically and numerically and the border for emergence of quantum chaos, induced by imperfections and residual inter-qubit couplings, is determined. This phenomenon appears in an isolated quantum computer without any external decoherence. The onset of quantum chaos leads to quantum computer hardware melting, strong quantum entropy growth and destruction of computer operability. The time scales for development of quantum chaos and ergodicity are determined. In spite the fact that this phenomenon is rather dangerous for quantum computing it is shown that the quantum chaos border for inter-qubit coupling is exponentially larger than the energy level spacing between quantum computer eigenstates and drops only linearly with the number of qubits n. As a result the ideal multi-qubit structure of the computer remains rather robust against imperfections. This opens a broad parameter region for a possible realization of quantum computer. The obtained results are related to the recent studies of quantum chaos in such many-body systems as nuclei, complex atoms and molecules, finite Fermi systems and quantum spin glass shards which are also reviewed in the paper.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1238/Physica.Topical.090a00112	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Quantum algorithmic information theory	Karl Svozil	Aucun	1995-10-05 12:09:46	The agenda of quantum algorithmic information theory, ordered `top-down,' is the quantum halting amplitude, followed by the quantum algorithmic information content, which in turn requires the theory of quantum computation. The fundamental atoms processed by quantum computation are the quantum bits which are dealt with in quantum information theory. The theory of quantum computation will be based upon a model of universal quantum computer whose elementary unit is a two-port interferometer capable of arbitrary $U(2)$ transformations. Basic to all these considerations is quantum theory, in particular Hilbert space quantum mechanics.	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9510005v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Quantum reservoir computing: a reservoir approach toward quantum machine
  learning on near-term quantum devices"	Keisuke Fujii	Kohei Nakajima	2020-11-10 04:45:52	Quantum systems have an exponentially large degree of freedom in the number of particles and hence provide a rich dynamics that could not be simulated on conventional computers. Quantum reservoir computing is an approach to use such a complex and rich dynamics on the quantum systems as it is for temporal machine learning. In this chapter, we explain quantum reservoir computing and related approaches, quantum extreme learning machine and quantum circuit learning, starting from a pedagogical introduction to quantum mechanics and machine learning. All these quantum machine learning approaches are experimentally feasible and effective on the state-of-the-art quantum devices.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04890v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Simulating Grover's Quantum Search in a Classical Computer	D. K. Ningtyas	A. B. Mutiara	2010-03-09 17:02:21	The rapid progress of computer science has been accompanied by a corresponding evolution of computation, from classical computation to quantum computation. As quantum computing is on its way to becoming an established discipline of computing science, much effort is being put into the development of new quantum algorithms. One of quantum algorithms is Grover algorithm, which is used for searching an element in an unstructured list of N elements with quadratic speed-up over classical algorithms. In this work, Quantum Computer Language (QCL) is used to make a Grover's quantum search simulation in a classical computer	http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1930v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Authorized quantum computation	Yu Tanaka	Mio Murao	2009-03-12 02:26:26	We present authorized quantum computation, where only a user with a non-cloneable quantum authorization key can perform a unitary operation created by an authenticated programmer. The security of our authorized quantum computation is based on the quantum computational complexity problem of forging the keys from an obfuscated quantum gate sequence. Under the assumption of the existence of a \textit{sufficiently-random gate shuffling algorithm}, the problem is shown to be in the NQP (Non-deterministic Quantum Polynomial)-hard class by reducing it to a NQP-Complete problem, the exact non-identity check problem. Therefore, our authorized quantum computation can be computationally secure against attacks using quantum computers.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2088v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Unifying Quantum Computation with Projective Measurements only and
  One-Way Quantum Computation"	Philippe Jorrand	Simon Perdrix	2004-04-21 14:44:41	Quantum measurement is universal for quantum computation. Two models for performing measurement-based quantum computation exist: the one-way quantum computer was introduced by Briegel and Raussendorf, and quantum computation via projective measurements only by Nielsen. The more recent development of this second model is based on state transfers instead of teleportation. From this development, a finite but approximate quantum universal family of observables is exhibited, which includes only one two-qubit observable, while others are one-qubit observables. In this article, an infinite but exact quantum universal family of observables is proposed, including also only one two-qubit observable.   The rest of the paper is dedicated to compare these two models of measurement-based quantum computation, i.e. one-way quantum computation and quantum computation via projective measurements only. From this comparison, which was initiated by Cirac and Verstraete, closer and more natural connections appear between these two models. These close connections lead to a unified view of measurement-based quantum computation.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.620302	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Measurement-only verifiable blind quantum computing with quantum input
  verification"	Tomoyuki Morimae	Aucun	2016-06-21 08:09:05	Verifiable blind quantum computing is a secure delegated quantum computing where a client with a limited quantum technology delegates her quantum computing to a server who has a universal quantum computer. The client's privacy is protected (blindness) and the correctness of the computation is verifiable by the client in spite of her limited quantum technology (verifiability). There are mainly two types of protocols for verifiable blind quantum computing: the protocol where the client has only to generate single-qubit states, and the protocol where the client needs only the ability of single-qubit measurements. The latter is called the measurement-only verifiable blind quantum computing. If the input of the client's quantum computing is a quantum state whose classical efficient description is not known to the client, there was no way for the measurement-only client to verify the correctness of the input. Here we introduce a new protocol of measurement-only verifiable blind quantum computing where the correctness of the quantum input is also verifiable.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.042301	cs	arxiv					0.0	
State Stabilization for Gate-Model Quantum Computers	Laszlo Gyongyosi	Sandor Imre	2019-09-03 10:26:07	Gate-model quantum computers can allow quantum computations in near-term implementations. The stabilization of an optimal quantum state of a quantum computer is a challenge, since it requires stable quantum evolutions via a precise calibration of the unitaries. Here, we propose a method for the stabilization of an optimal quantum state of a quantum computer through an arbitrary number of running sequences. The optimal state of the quantum computer is set to maximize an objective function of an arbitrary problem fed into the quantum computer. We also propose a procedure to classify the stabilized quantum states of the quantum computer into stability classes. The results are convenient for gate-model quantum computations and near-term quantum computers.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11128-019-2397-0	cs	arxiv					0.0

Introduction to topological quantum computation with non-Abelian anyons	Bernard Field	Tapio Simula	2018-02-17 02:56:35	Topological quantum computers promise a fault tolerant means to perform quantum computation. Topological quantum computers use particles with exotic exchange statistics called non-Abelian anyons, and the simplest anyon model which allows for universal quantum computation by particle exchange or braiding alone is the Fibonacci anyon model. One classically hard problem that can be solved efficiently using quantum computation is finding the value of the Jones polynomial of knots at roots of unity. We aim to provide a pedagogical, self-contained, review of topological quantum computation with Fibonacci anyons, from the braiding statistics and matrices to the layout of such a computer and the compiling of braids to perform specific operations. Then we use a simulation of a topological quantum computer to explicitly demonstrate a quantum computation using Fibonacci anyons, evaluating the Jones polynomial of a selection of simple knots. In addition to simulating a modular circuit-style quantum algorithm, we also show how the magnitude of the Jones polynomial at specific points could be obtained exactly using Fibonacci or Ising anyons. Such an exact algorithm seems ideally suited for a proof of concept demonstration of a topological quantum computer.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2058-9565/aacad2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Password authentication schemes on a quantum computer	Sherry Wang	Carlisle Adams, Anne Broadbent	2022-01-29 06:40:39	In a post-quantum world, where attackers may have access to full-scale quantum computers, all classical password-based authentication schemes will be compromised. Quantum copy-protection prevents adversaries from making copies of existing quantum software; we suggest this as a possible approach for designing post-quantum-secure password authentication systems. In this paper, we show an implementation of quantum copy-protection for password verification on IBM quantum computers. We also share our quantum computation results and analyses, as well as lessons learned.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/QCE52317.2021.00051	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Duality and Recycling Computing in Quantum Computers	Gui Lu Long	Yang Liu	2007-08-15 03:17:30	Quantum computer possesses quantum parallelism and offers great computing power over classical computer \cite{er1,er2}. As is well-know, a moving quantum object passing through a double-slit exhibits particle wave duality. A quantum computer is static and lacks this duality property. The recently proposed duality computer has exploited this particle wave duality property, and it may offer additional computing power \cite{r1}. Simply put it, a duality computer is a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer offers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming out of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. Here we show that an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer. In a duality mode, computing operations are not necessarily unitary. A $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical computer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical computer. The duality mode provides a natural link between classical computing and quantum computing. Here we also propose a recycling computing mode in which a quantum computer will continue to compute until the result is obtained. These two modes provide new tool for algorithm design. A search algorithm for the unsorted database search problem is designed.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0253-6102/50/6/11	cs	arxiv					0.0

A Parallel Quantum Computer Simulator	Kevin M. Obenland	Alvin M. Despain	1998-04-16 02:40:50	A Quantum Computer is a new type of computer which can efficiently solve complex problems such as prime factorization. A quantum computer threatens the security of public key encryption systems because these systems rely on the fact that prime factorization is computationally difficult. Errors limit the effectiveness of quantum computers. Because of the exponential nature of quantum com puters, simulating the effect of errors on them requires a vast amount of processing and memory resources. In this paper we describe a parallel simulator which accesses the feasibility of quantum computers. We also derive and validate an analytical model of execution time for the simulator, which shows that parallel quantum computer simulation is very scalable.	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9804039v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Classification of Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing	Frank Phillipson	Niels Neumann, Robert Wezeman	2022-10-27 10:52:37	As quantum computers mature, the applicability in practice becomes more important. Many uses of quantum computers will be hybrid, with classical computers still playing an important role in operating and using the quantum computer. The term hybrid is however diffuse and multi-interpretable. In this work we define two classes of hybrid quantum-classical computing: vertical and horizontal. The first is application-agnostic and concerns using quantum computers. The second is application-specific and concerns running an algorithm. For both, we give a further subdivision in different types of hybrid quantum-classical computing and we coin terms for them.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15314v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

Experimental verification of quantum computations	Stefanie Barz	Joseph F. Fitzsimons, Elham Kashefi, Philip Walther	2013-08-30 20:00:02	Quantum computers are expected to offer substantial speedups over their classical counterparts and to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. Beyond such practical significance, the concept of quantum computation opens up new fundamental questions, among them the issue whether or not quantum computations can be certified by entities that are inherently unable to compute the results themselves. Here we present the first experimental verification of quantum computations. We show, in theory and in experiment, how a verifier with minimal quantum resources can test a significantly more powerful quantum computer. The new verification protocol introduced in this work utilizes the framework of blind quantum computing and is independent of the experimental quantum-computation platform used. In our scheme, the verifier is only required to generate single qubits and transmit them to the quantum computer. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol using four photonic qubits and show how the verifier can test the computer's ability to perform measurement-based quantum computations.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphys2763	cs	arxiv					0.0

We consider a model of quantum computations in which the state is an operator of density matrix and the gates are quantum operations, not necessarily unitary. A mixed state (operator of density matrix) of n two-level quantum systems is considered as an element of $4^{n}$-dimensional operator Hilbert space. Unitary quantum gates and nonunitary quantum operations for n-qubit system are considered as generalized quantum gates acting on mixed state.

A Practitioner's Guide to Quantum Algorithms for Optimisation Problems	Benjamin C. B. Symons	David Galvin, Emre Sahin, Vassil Alexandrov, Stefano Mensa	2023-05-12 08:57:36	Quantum computing is gaining popularity across a wide range of scientific disciplines due to its potential to solve long-standing computational problems that are considered intractable with classical computers. One promising area where quantum computing has potential is in the speed-up of NP-hard optimisation problems that are common in industrial areas such as logistics and finance. Newcomers to the field of quantum computing who are interested in using this technology to solve optimisation problems do not have an easily accessible source of information on the current capabilities of quantum computers and algorithms. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theory of quantum optimisation techniques and their practical application, focusing on their near-term potential for noisy intermediate scale quantum devices. Two main paradigms for quantum hardware are then discussed: quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computing. While quantum annealers are effective for some optimisation problems, they have limitations and cannot be used for universal quantum computation. In contrast, gate-based quantum computers offer the potential for universal quantum computation, but they face challenges with hardware limitations and accurate gate implementation. The paper provides a detailed mathematical discussion with references to key works in the field, as well as a more practical discussion with relevant examples. The most popular techniques for quantum optimisation on gate-based quantum computers, the quantum approximate optimisation (QAO) algorithm and the quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) framework, are discussed in detail. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges facing quantum optimisation techniques and the need for further research and development to identify new, effective methods for achieving quantum advantage.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07323v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Quantum State Optimization and Computational Pathway Evaluation for
  Gate-Model Quantum Computers"	Laszlo Gyongyosi	Aucun	2020-03-11 12:20:37	A computational problem fed into a gate-model quantum computer identifies an objective function with a particular computational pathway (objective function connectivity). The solution of the computational problem involves identifying a target objective function value that is the subject to be reached. A bottleneck in a gate-model quantum computer is the requirement of several rounds of quantum state preparations, high-cost run sequences, and multiple rounds of measurements to determine a target (optimal) state of the quantum computer that achieves the target objective function value. Here, we define a method for optimal quantum state determination and computational path evaluation for gate-model quantum computers. We prove a state determination method that finds a target system state for a quantum computer at a given target objective function value. The computational pathway evaluation procedure sets the connectivity of the objective function in the target system state on a fixed hardware architecture of the quantum computer. The proposed solution evolves the target system state without requiring the preparation of intermediate states between the initial and target states of the quantum computer. Our method avoids high-cost system state preparations and expensive running procedures and measurement apparatuses in gate-model quantum computers. The results are convenient for gate-model quantum computations and the near-term quantum devices of the quantum Internet.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61316-4	cs	arxiv					0.0

"Quantum Circuit Design for Objective Function Maximization in Gate-Model
  Quantum Computers"	Laszlo Gyongyosi	Sandor Imre	2018-03-06 22:48:27	Gate-model quantum computers provide an experimentally implementable architecture for near term quantum computations. To design a reduced quantum circuit that can simulate a high complexity reference quantum circuit, an optimization should be taken on the number of input quantum states, on the unitary operations of the quantum circuit, and on the number of output measurement rounds. Besides the optimization of the physical layout of the hardware layer, the quantum computer should also solve difficult computational problems very efficiently. To yield a desired output system, a particular objective function associated with the computational problem fed into the quantum computer should be maximized. The reduced gate structure should be able to produce the maximized value of the objective function. These parallel requirements must be satisfied simultaneously, which makes the optimization difficult. Here, we demonstrate a method for designing quantum circuits for gate-model quantum computers and define the Quantum Triple Annealing Minimization (QTAM) algorithm. The aim of QTAM is to determine an optimal reduced topology for the quantum circuits in the hardware layer at the maximization of the objective function of an arbitrary computational problem.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11128-019-2326-2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Quantum Reservoir Computing Implementations for Classical and Quantum
  Problems"	Adam Burgess	Marian Florescu	2022-11-15 23:19:26	In this article we employ a model open quantum system consisting of two-level atomic systems coupled to Lorentzian photonic cavities, as an instantiation of a quantum physical reservoir computer. We then deployed the quantum reservoir computing approach to an archetypal machine learning problem of image recognition. We contrast the effectiveness of the quantum physical reservoir computer against a conventional approach using neural network of the similar architecture with the quantum physical reservoir computer layer removed. Remarkably, as the data set size is increased the quantum physical reservoir computer quickly starts out perform the conventional neural network. Furthermore, quantum physical reservoir computer provides superior effectiveness against number of training epochs at a set data set size and outperformed the neural network approach at every epoch number sampled. Finally, we have deployed the quantum physical reservoir computer approach to explore the quantum problem associated with the dynamics of open quantum systems in which an atomic system ensemble interacts with a structured photonic reservoir associated with a photonic band gap material. Our results demonstrate that the quantum physical reservoir computer is equally effective in generating useful representations for quantum problems, even with limited training data size.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08567v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Quantum computing through the lens of control: A tutorial introduction	Julian Berberich	Daniel Fink	2023-10-19 08:25:50	Quantum computing is a fascinating interdisciplinary research field that promises to revolutionize computing by efficiently solving previously intractable problems. Recent years have seen tremendous progress on both the experimental realization of quantum computing devices as well as the development and implementation of quantum algorithms. Yet, realizing computational advantages of quantum computers in practice remains a widely open problem due to numerous fundamental challenges. Interestingly, many of these challenges are connected to performance, robustness, scalability, optimization, or feedback, all of which are central concepts in control theory. This paper provides a tutorial introduction to quantum computing from the perspective of control theory. We introduce the mathematical framework of quantum algorithms ranging from basic elements including quantum bits and quantum gates to more advanced concepts such as variational quantum algorithms and quantum errors. The tutorial only requires basic knowledge of linear algebra and, in particular, no prior exposure to quantum physics. Our main goal is to equip readers with the mathematical basics required to understand and possibly solve (control-related) problems in quantum computing. In particular, beyond the tutorial introduction, we provide a list of research challenges in the field of quantum computing and discuss their connections to control.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12571v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Experimental One-Way Quantum Computing	P. Walther	K. J. Resch, T. Rudolph, E. Schenck, H. Weinfurter, V. Vedral, M. Aspelmeyer, A. Zeilinger	2005-03-14 14:56:00	Standard quantum computation is based on sequences of unitary quantum logic gates which process qubits. The one-way quantum computer proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel is entirely different. It has changed our understanding of the requirements for quantum computation and more generally how we think about quantum physics. This new model requires qubits to be initialized in a highly-entangled cluster state. From this point, the quantum computation proceeds by a sequence of single-qubit measurements with classical feedforward of their outcomes. Because of the essential role of measurement a one-way quantum computer is irreversible. In the one-way quantum computer the order and choices of measurements determine the algorithm computed. We have experimentally realized four-qubit cluster states encoded into the polarization state of four photons. We fully characterize the quantum state by implementing the first experimental four-qubit quantum state tomography. Using this cluster state we demonstrate the feasibility of one-way quantum computing through a universal set of one- and two-qubit operations. Finally, our implementation of Grover's search algorithm demonstrates that one-way quantum computation is ideally suited for such tasks.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature03347	cs	arxiv					0.0

A quantum cellular automaton for universal quantum computation	Robert Raussendorf	Aucun	2004-12-06 21:56:54	I describe a quantum cellular automaton capable of performing universal quantum computation.

Digital-analog quantum algorithm for the quantum Fourier transform	Ana Martin	Lucas Lamata, Enrique Solano, Mikel Sanz	2019-06-18 15:15:52	Quantum computers will allow calculations beyond existing classical computers. However, current technology is still too noisy and imperfect to construct a universal digital quantum computer with quantum error correction. Inspired by the evolution of classical computation, an alternative paradigm merging the flexibility of digital quantum computation with the robustness of analog quantum simulation has emerged. This universal paradigm is known as digital-analog quantum computing. Here, we introduce an efficient digital-analog quantum algorithm to compute the quantum Fourier transform, a subroutine widely employed in several relevant quantum algorithms. We show that, under reasonable assumptions about noise models, the fidelity of the quantum Fourier transformation improves considerably using this approach when the number of qubits involved grows. This suggests that, in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, hybrid protocols combining digital and analog quantum computing could be a sensible approach to reach useful quantum supremacy.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.013012	cs	arxiv					0.0

A way toward the realization of intelligent quantum robots is to adopt a quantum metalanguage to control quantum robots. A physical implementation of a quantum metalanguage might be the use of coherent states in brain signals.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4614v2	cs	arxiv					0.0

"The universal quantum driving force to speed up a quantum computation --
  The unitary quantum dynamics"	Xijia Miao	Aucun	2011-05-18 09:41:54	It is shown in the paper that the unitary quantum dynamics in quantum mechanics is the universal quantum driving force to speed up a quantum computation. This assertion supports strongly in theory that the unitary quantum dynamics is the fundamental and universal principle in nature. On the other hand, the symmetric structure of Hilbert space of a composite quantum system is the quantum-computing resource that is not owned by classical computation. A new quantum-computing speedup theory is set up on the basis of the unitary quantum dynamics. Both the unitary quantum dynamics and the symmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space of the quantum system are mainly responsible for an exponential quantum-computing speedup for a general efficient quantum algorithm. The inherent importance for the unitary quantum dynamics to speed up a quantum computation lies in the unique ability of the unitary quantum dynamics to build the effective interaction between the symmetric structure of the Hilbert space of the quantum system and the mathematical symmetric structure of a problem to be solved on the quantum system. This unique ability could result in an essential difference of computational power between quantum and classical computations by combining the symmetric structure and property of the Hilbert space. The new quantum-computing speedup theory also provides reasonable mechanisms for exponential quantum-computing speedup for the existing efficient quantum algorithms based on the quantum parallel principle. These existing quantum algorithms including the hidden-subgroup-problem quantum algorithms and conventional quantum search algorithms have the common character that the symmetric structure of the Hilbert space does not have any effective effect on these quantum algorithms. This could be the main reason why these quantum algorithms are quite special and considered to be semiclassical.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3573v3	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Fault-tolerant quantum computation	Peter W. Shor	Aucun	1996-05-13 14:29:00	Recently, it was realized that use of the properties of quantum mechanics might speed up certain computations dramatically. Interest in quantum computation has since been growing. One of the main difficulties of realizing quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a superposition of states in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. A futher difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering the output of long computations unreliable. It was previously known that a quantum circuit with t gates could tolerate O(1/t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate. We show, for any quantum computation with t gates, how to build a polynomial size quantum circuit that can tolerate O(1/(log t)^c) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c. We do this by showing how to compute using quantum error correcting codes. These codes were previously known to provide resistance to errors while storing and transmitting quantum data.	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605011v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Quantum Computing for Power Flow Algorithms: Testing on real Quantum
  Computers"	Brynjar Sævarsson	Spyros Chatzivasileiadis, Hjörtur Jóhannsson, Jacob Østergaard	2022-04-29 11:53:16	Quantum computing has the potential to solve many computational problems exponentially faster than classical computers. The high shares of renewables and the wide deployment of converter-interfaced resources require new tools that shall drastically accelerate power system computations, including optimization and security assessment, which can benefit from quantum computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that goes beyond quantum computing simulations and performs an experimental application of Quantum Computing for power systems on a real quantum computer. We use five different quantum computers, apply the HHL quantum algorithm, and examine the impact of current noisy quantum hardware on the accuracy and speed of an AC power flow algorithm. We perform the same studies on a 3-bus and a 5-bus system with real quantum computers to identify challenges and open research questions related with the scalability of these algorithms.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14028v4	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"A quantum walk control plane for distributed quantum computing in
  quantum networks"	Matheus Guedes de Andrade	Wenhan Dai, Saikat Guha, Don Towsley	2021-06-17 22:19:15	Quantum networks are complex systems formed by the interaction among quantum processors through quantum channels. Analogous to classical computer networks, quantum networks allow for the distribution of quantum computation among quantum computers. In this work, we describe a quantum walk protocol to perform distributed quantum computing in a quantum network. The protocol uses a quantum walk as a quantum control signal to perform distributed quantum operations. We consider a generalization of the discrete-time coined quantum walk model that accounts for the interaction between a quantum walker system in the network graph with quantum registers inside the network nodes. The protocol logically captures distributed quantum computing, abstracting hardware implementation and the transmission of quantum information through channels. Control signal transmission is mapped to the propagation of the walker system across the network, while interactions between the control layer and the quantum registers are embedded into the application of coin operators. We demonstrate how to use the quantum walker system to perform a distributed CNOT operation, which shows the universality of the protocol for distributed quantum computing. Furthermore, we apply the protocol to the task of entanglement distribution in a quantum network.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09839v2	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Introducing the Quantum Research Kernels: Lessons from Classical
  Parallel Computing"	A. Y. Matsuura	Timothy G. Mattson	2022-11-02 03:19:58	Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift for computation requiring an entirely new computer architecture. However, there is much that can be learned from traditional classical computer engineering. In this paper, we describe the Parallel Research Kernels (PRK), a tool that was very useful for designing classical parallel computing systems. The PRK are simple kernels written to expose bottlenecks that limit classical parallel computing performance. We hypothesize that an analogous tool for quantum computing, Quantum Research Kernels (QRK), may similarly aid the co-design of software and hardware for quantum computing systems, and we give a few examples of representative QRKs.	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00844v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Quantum finite automata: survey, status and research directions	Amandeep Singh Bhatia	Ajay Kumar	2019-01-23 16:44:21	Quantum computing is concerned with computer technology based on the principles of quantum mechanics, with operations performed at the quantum level. Quantum computational models make it possible to analyze the resources required for computations. Quantum automata can be classified thusly: quantum finite automata, quantum sequential machine, quantum pushdown automata, quantum Turing machine and orthomodular lattice-valued automata. These models are useful for determining the expressive power and boundaries of various computational features. In light of the current state of quantum computation theory research, a systematic review of the literature seems timely. This article seeks to provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of quantum finite automata models, quantum finite automata models with density operators and quantum finite automata models with classical states, interactive proof systems, quantum communication complexity and query complexity as described in the literature. The statistics of quantum finite automata related papers are shown and open problems are identified for more advanced research. The current status of quantum automata theory is distributed into various categories. This research work also highlights the previous research, current status and future directions of quantum automata models.	http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07992v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
A Survey of Quantum Programming Languages: History, Methods, and Tools	Donald A.

This paper briefly surveys the history, methods, and proposed tools for programming quantum computers circa late 2007. It is intended to provide an extensive but non-exhaustive look at work leading up to the current state-of-the-art in quantum computer programming. Further, it is an attempt to analyze the needed programming tools for quantum programmers, to use this analysis to predict the direction in which the field is moving, and to make recommendations for further development of quantum programming language tools.	http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1118v1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
"Simulation of memristive synapses and neuromorphic computing on a
  quantum computer"	Ying Li	Aucun	2020-07-19 03:15:25	One of the major approaches to neuromorphic computing is using memristors as analogue synapses. We propose unitary quantum gates that exhibit memristive behaviours, including Ohm's law, pinched hysteresis loop and synaptic plasticity. Hysteresis depending on the quantum phase and long-term plasticity that encodes the quantum state are observed. We also propose a three-layer neural network with the capability of universal quantum computing. Quantum state classification on the memristive neural network is demonstrated. Our results pave the way towards brain-inspired quantum computing. We obtain these results in numerical simulations and experiments on the superconducting quantum computer ibmq_vigo.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.023146	cs	arxiv					0.0

In this article, we aim to provide a non-technical, yet informative introduction to key aspects of quantum computing. We discuss whether quantum computers one day might become useful tools for numerical weather and climate prediction. Using a recently developed quantum algorithm for solving non-linear differential equations, we integrate a simple non-linear model. In addition to considering the advantages that quantum computers have to offer, we shall also discuss the challenges one faces when trying to use quantum computers for real-world problems involving ''big data'', such as weather prediction.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-22-0031.1	cs	arxiv					0.0	
Beyond Quantum Computation and Towards Quantum Field Computation	A. C. Manoharan	Aucun	2003-04-19 16:00:35	Because the subject of relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) contains all of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we expect quantum field computation to contain (non-relativistic) quantum computation. Although we do not yet have a quantum theory of the gravitational field, and are far from a practical implementation of a quantum field computer, some pieces of the puzzle (without gravity) are now available. We consider a general model for computation with quantum field theory, and obtain some results for relativistic quantum computation. Moreover, it is possible to see new connections between principal models of computation, namely, computation over the continuum and computation over the integers (Turing computation). Thus we identify a basic problem in QFT, namely Wightman's computation problem for domains of holomorphy, which we call WHOLO. Inspired by the same analytic functions which are central to the famous CPT theorem of QFT, it is possible to obtain a computational complexity structure for QFT and shed new light on certain complexity classes for this problem WHOLO.	http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0304136v1	cs	arxiv					0.0

So how *does* quantum computing work?	atimholt	Aucun	2011-05-28 07:40:42	"I've read a few vague descriptions of what quantum computers are capable of, but not really anything about working with them. Eventually, when we've got these things, writers of those programming books for bare, bare beginners (just throwing that out as an example) will need to be able to explain their workings simply.  So I've been pondering lately, and I think I've begun to get a handle on how they work. What I understand of them has gotten me very excited, but my understanding of them is based on gleaned knowledge.  As far as I'm aware: **EDIT: I was dead wrong, read the comments for real science!**  1. Quantum computing relies on being able to ""choose"" one superimposed state over another based on arbitrary criteria. This might be seen as akin to the cat in Schrodinger's box clawing its way out. What happens when more than one version of the cat wants out, I have no idea (a random one wins, I'm sure). Is there a way to compare a number between two superpositions and 'legitimize' the superposition with the larger value?  2. Nothing stops you from putting a ""Schrodinger's cat box"" inside another ""Schrodinger's cat box"". You can compound the effect recursively. Yes?  With two and one above together, you can make a binary tree of ""meta-Schrodinger boxes"" with a qubit at each branch. You could test an *astronomical* number of superpositions against each other using whatever fitness number you see fit.  So a quantum computer would be analogous to a genetic algorithm, except that instead of randomizing gene variables each generation, you test *every possible variant at the same time* and return the best one in nearly constant time.  Deterministic, complete information games would be unbeatable if you can come up with a proper way to generate a fitness numbers--a computer could play every permutation of a game of chess or go.  And such things as getting bipedal robots to walk would be trivial (if a bit uncanny valley) if the program understands physics and its own weight and capabilities--it could calculate every little twitch.  If I'm dead wrong, thanks for reading this far, at least.

IamA Quantum Computer Guy AMA!	quantum_jim	Aucun	2018-05-24 14:34:15	**My short bio:** I am Dr James Wootton, a researcher at the University of Basel. I work on the development of quantum computers.  Though useful applications of quantum computers are still a few years away, there are already [devices that are publicly available](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx) for anyone to play with. So I try to help people get started with quantum programming by writing tutorial articles, coming up with simple examples of quantum programs (like [simple games](https://medium.com/qiskitters/how-to-program-a-quantum-computer-982a9329ed02) or a [superposition of emoticons](https://medium.com/qiskitters/making-a-quantum-computer-smile-cee86a6fc1de)) and [open sourcing the code behind my research papers](https://github.com/decodoku/).  Most recently, Ive been collaborating with IBM Research on a project called [Hello Quantum](http://helloquantum.mybluemix.net/). At the heart of this is a simple and casual puzzle game based on quantum programming.  **My Proof:** [Me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/decodoku/status/999658805750304769)  **Edit:** I'll have to call it a day now.

Science AMA Series: We are quantum technology researchers from Switzerland. We’ll be talking about quantum computers, quantum entanglement, quantum foundations, quantum dots, and other quantum stuff. AMA!	QSIT_Researchers	Aucun	2016-07-18 12:06:16	"Hi Reddit,  **Edit 22nd July: The day of the AMA has passed, but we are still committed to answering questions. You can keep on asking!**  We are researchers working on the theoretical and experimental development of quantum technology as part of the Swiss project [QSIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1JFAxhrBFw). Today we launched a project called [Decodoku](http://decodoku.blogspot.ch/2016/01/welcome-to-decodoku-this-is-blog-for.html) that lets you take part in our research through a couple of smartphone apps. To celebrate, we are here to answer all your quantum questions.   **Dr James Wootton**  I work on the theory of quantum computation at the University of Basel. I specifically work on topological quantum computation, which seeks to use particles called [anyons](http://decodoku.blogspot.ch/2016/06/anyons.html). Unfortunately, they aren’t the kind of particles that turn up at CERN. Instead we need to use different tactics to tease them into existence. My main focus is on [quantum error correction](http://decodoku.blogspot.ch/2016/02/5-story-so-far_57.html), which is the method needed to manage noise in quantum computers.  I am the one behind the Decodoku project (and founded /r/decodoku), so feel free to ask me about that. As part of the project I wrote a series of [blog posts](http://decodoku.blogspot.ch/2016/02/5-story-so-far_57.html) on quantum error correction and [qubits](http://decodoku.blogspot.ch/2016/02/the-maths-of-qubits.html), so ask me about those too. But I’m not just here to talk about Rampart, so ask me anything. I’ll be here from 8am ET (1200 GMT, 1400 CEST), until I finally succumb to sleep.  I’ll also be on [Meet the MeQuanics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3s7vtrVha2OotBMWXIiZXQ) tomorrow and I’m always around under the guise of /u/quantum_jim, should you need more of me for some reason.   **Prof Daniel Loss and Dr Christoph Kloeffel**  Prof Loss is head of the Condensed matter theory and quantum computing group at the University of Basel. He proposed the use of [spin qubits for QIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss%E2%80%93DiVincenzo_quantum_computer), now a major avenue of research, along with David DiVincenzo in 1997. He currently works on condensed matter topics (like [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot)), quantum information topics (like suppressing noise in quantum computers) and ways to build the latter from the former. He also works on the theory of topological quantum matter, quantum memories (see our [review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6643)), and topological quantum computing, in particular on Majorana Fermions and parafermions in nanowires and topological insulators.  Dr Kloeffel is a theoretical physicist in the group of Prof Loss, and is an expert in spin qubits and quantum dots. Together with Prof Loss, he has written a review article on [Prospects for Spin-Based Quantum Computing in Quantum Dots](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-conmatphys-030212-184248) (an initial preprint is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5917)). He is also a member of the international research project [SiSPIN](http://www.sispin.eu).   **Prof Richard Warburton**  Prof Richard Warburton leads the experimental Nano-Photonics group at the University of Basel. The overriding goal is to create useful hardware for quantum information applications: a spin qubit and a single photon source. The single photon source should be a fast and bright source of indistinguishable photons on demand. The spin qubit should remain stable for long enough to do many operations in a quantum computer. Current projects develop quantum hardware with solid-state materials (semiconductors and diamond). Richard is co-Director of the pan-Switzerland project QSIT.   **Dr Lidia del Rio**  Lidia is a researcher in the fields of quantum information, quantum foundations and quantum thermodynamics. She has recently joined the group of Prof Renato Renner at ETH Zurich. Prof Renner’s group researches the theory of quantum information, and also studies fundamental topics in quantum theory from the point of view of information, such as by using quantum entanglement. A recent example is a proof that quantum mechanics is only compatible with many-world interpretations. A talk given by Lidia on this topic can be found [here](http://pirsa.org/16060101/).   **Dr Félix Bussières**  [Dr Bussières](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=xoNzM5cAAAAJ&hl=en) is part of the GAP Quantum Technologies group at the University of Geneva. They do experiments on quantum teleportation, cryptography and communication. Dr Bussières leads activities on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors.   **Dr Matthias Troyer** from ETH Zurich also [responded to a question on D-Wave](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4tev0n/science_ama_series_we_are_quantum_technology/d5h1rr4?context=3), since he has worked on looking at its capabilities (among much other research).  **Links to our project**  * [Website](http://decodoku.blogspot.ch/2016/01/welcome-to-decodoku-this-is-blog-for.html) * /r/decodoku * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/decodoku) * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpH8JwlUfbC2sfY6ywuizEw) * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/305800243101387/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel)  Edit: Thanks to Lidia currently being in Canada, attending the ""It from Qubit summer school"" at the Perimeter Institute, we also had some guest answerers.

Uploading consciousness to quantum computers	Rubydev39	Aucun	2022-12-21 19:30:38	This issue has been bothering me for a week. I think this will be possible in the future. It is thought that quantum computers will enter our lives in 2030 and a huge change will be made in the financial field. I think in 2040 or 2050 the rich (billionaires) will be able to load their consciousness into the universes they have created and live in the fantasy world they want there. In 2060, millionaires will be able to do this. This seems very dangerous to me.some theories say that you can become immortal by doing this, but this is ridiculous, maybe in the future or impossible.Do you think this is possible	https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/zrybpe/uploading_consciousness_to_quantum_computers/		reddit	zrybpe	Futurology	105.0	105.0	522.0	Computing

Quantum Computing:	timewourp	Aucun	2023-07-14 22:41:36	Hey y’all, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole that is quantum computing and I’m convinced it will have some significant impact and scalable use cases within the coming years (5-10…+?).  When it comes to investment opportunities relating to emerging/experimental technologies, it can be difficult for retail investors to find early-stage direct investment opportunities.   BUT, the standout player, IonQ ($IONQ) is publicly traded. Here are some reasons why I’m bullish and think IonQ is oh, so special!  1. IonQ uses trapped ion/photonic computing!! This is really neat because it means their quantum computers do not need to be kept at FREEZING temps like QCs being created by Google, IBM, Rigetti and most others. (Among many other advantages)   Compared to the trapped ion approach, the qubits generated via superconducting suffer from short coherence times, high error rates, limited connectivity, and higher estimated error-correction overhead  2. Management is fairly new to running a public company but they seem excited and dedicated based off interviews and press releases: “The lead is ours. And we have full intention to take advantage of it.”  3. IonQ is the first and only quantum hardware integrated with all major cloud platforms and software kits!  4. 80% of their system is made outside of the US  5. 55+ US patents, 136 US patents pending, 7 foreign patents, 99 foreign patents pending, 8 US trademarks, 11 US trademarks pending, 17 international trademarks, 7 international trademarks pending  6. Their approach for the near term is to form a limited number of strategic partnerships to develop solutions that open up quantum advantage in select industry sectors (chem, pharma, finance, logistics).  7. What I think sets them apart the most, besides trapped ion, is their focus on scalability. Since their inception, Peter Chapman, their CEO, has been stressing the importance of their QCs being modular, economical, and serviceable. THIS, in my opinion, is the way. Whereas Google and IBM will have huge, frozen, immobile QCs available to contract via the cloud, IonQ will have a portable, scalable product.  $IONQ	https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14zuj7e/quantum_computing/		reddit	14zuj7e	stocks	18.0	18.0	50.0	Company Discussion

Bitcoin and quantum computing	wiy_alxd	Aucun	2023-08-24 18:23:41	This might have been discussed before, and I am aware of the many complications involved in making this a real bitcoin weakness in the near to even long term, but I would like to hear your thoughts and knowledge on the matter if we consider the recent advancements in quantum computing made by Google, for example, and how this will eventually affect bitcoin, say in 25, 50 or even 100 years.  The main aspect that interest me is the following: Other blockchain payment projects, for example ethereum and solana (...), are getting and will be getting updates to counter the technological advances made by advanced computing, when current cryptographic protocols are made less secure. For example, we don't use anymore certain hashing methods because they are now deemed not secure enough. In many many years, when computers can solve difficulty problems easily, like mining, in seconds instead of thousand of years, how relevant will bitcoin be, if it's not getting those updates?  Or is bitcoin going to evolve as well, like projects such as ethererum who have quantum computing concerns in their future proofing roadmaps?  Thank you!  *edit: I am a dev, and do some blockchain programming and read a lot of tech news on the subject, so I don't mind getting super technical responses.	https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1609wf3/bitcoin_and_quantum_computing/		reddit	1609wf3	CryptoCurrency	11.0	11.0	46.0	DISCUSSION
